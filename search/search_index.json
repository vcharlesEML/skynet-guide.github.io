Don\u2019t expect any scoring or a table \u2013 many projects have these made in a way that highlights their own project and misinforms users about the others. We are trying to make the research easier for you and provide you with the technical information in easy to understand way. Chains compared: From a Technical Perspective In this section I will be breaking down the technical differences between the major players in the \u201cdecentralized\u201d storage space (quotes will be explained later). Though, keep in mind that I am prominent in the Sia community so all of my opinions obviously have a bias and should be taken with a grain of salt. First off, we need to decide which players to consider in the breakdown. I have settled on four competitors. Filecoin When people think \u201cdecentralized storage\u201d this is the first thing to come to mind. They had a massive ICO that raised over $250M and a darling team from the decentralized community behind the product (Protocol Labs) which have previously developed IPFS (see more here ). To say the least, hopes have been very high for Filecoin and they finally reached mainnet after many years of work on new tech in late 2020. So, since they are the big name I\u2019m of course going to include them in this comparison. Sia Started in 2014, Sia was one of the first \u201cdecentralized storage\u201d protocols to come to fruition. Not only that, it has been in mainnet for years now which has allowed a small but dedicated group of devs to work on the project. Total development cost over the years was around $6.6M for Sia and another $3M were raised for development of Skynet in 2020. It\u2019s also worth mentioning that Sia never had an ICO and is the only of these projects that didn\u2019t fund the development with the network\u2019s own token, Siacoin (SC). Skynet is an interesting L2 (layer two) solution addressing content distribution that was released in early 2020 (which you may be reading this on right now) that utilizes Sia\u2019s decentralized storage and makes Sia a good point to compare against. Storj Storj was another one of the crypto projects that started in 2014. They released Storj v1 for public beta back right at inception and have aggressively targeted b2b customers by posing themselves as an S3 drop in replacement. This has recently culminated in the real public release of Storj v3 through tardigrade . Storj raised $35.4M through multiple funding rounds, though most of it ($30M) was raised during its ICO in 2017. 0Chain 0Chain is a tad different than the other competitors due to it\u2019s eccentric take on the network architecture. For example, their decision to do all transactions on chain with sub-second block times is quite the contrast to Sia\u2019s approach of the usual Bitcoin 10 minute block times. Despite 0chain not actually being in mainnet (which I was considering making a requirement to be in this comparison), I think the tech is advanced and interesting enough to warrant being part of this. 0Chain raised $5.9M during its ICO in 2017. What is to be Compared? I thought the most important things to consider when comparing the technical sides of these storage chains would be the following: Consensus Algorithms Block time (and why) Enforcement of data retention Content distribution Sector size \u201cDecentralization\u201d Let us begin. Chains compared: Consensus Algorithms This section is undoubtedly the most complex of all of the sections due to wild variance between the different chains and how they find quorum. There is a good chance that I mess something up. If you do find anything wrong, feel free to send me a message on discord (I\u2019m \u2102\ud835\udd60\ud835\udd67\ud835\udd52\ud835\udd5d\ud835\udd56\ud835\udd5f\ud835\udd65#5766 btw). Filecoin Filecoin uses an odd variation of PoS (proof of stake) called PoSt (proof of space time). It effectively works by creating a \u201cpower table\u201d by testing the usable capacity of the hosts that offer capacity to the network (also used capacity by users provide more power than just plain storage offered to the network). Then a \u201crandomness beacon\u201d is used to select a random host weighted by the power table. So if a miner offers twice the capacity of another miner, it is twice as likely to get chosen as the block leader. This block leader can then use previously grabbed transactions and form a new block based on them (making sure to pay themselves). Read more here . This method of consensus is unproven and has it\u2019s own set of issues; namely that the host and the miner (who have separate interests) are now acting as one entity. And due to the cutting edge nature of the tech, we just don\u2019t know when these motives will clash the hardest and when the algorithm will fall apart. Though, only time will tell how it plays out. Sia Sia uses a near identical consensus algorithm as Bitcoin. I\u2019m not gonna go into too much detail here because the fundamentals are much better explained here by 3blue1brown then I ever could, but the basic idea is as following: People broadcast transactions into transaction pool. These transactions include a fee that is an inicentive for miners to choose their transaction over others. Every miner looks into the transaction pool and grabs those transactions that\u2019ll make them the most money. Then they create a transaction that will give them the block reward and incorporates the last block into a new one that ensures immutability of blockchain. Every miner then repeatedly tries to \u201chash\u201d their respective newly created block with specialized hardware specific to the task called an ASIC (application specific integrated circuit). Finally, whoever gets a special number from this hash first gets to claim their block reward by broadcasting the block to network. That makes the block part of blockchain and entire process repeats over and over with a next block. This is a dramatic over-simplification of PoW and I highly recommend the 3blue1brown video for those who want to understand it in more detail. But the essence is that very expensive and specialized hardware and a huge amount of electricity is used to perform effectively useless computation in order to make money and secure the network. It isn\u2019t particularly efficient, doesn\u2019t scale super well to a huge number of transactions, and requires a long block time to function properly; but it is extremely resilient to any number of attacks and has proved to work very well at it\u2019s job through the success of Bitcoin which runs since 2009 with 100% uptime. Storj Storj is the only project in this comparison that doesn\u2019t have it\u2019s own chain; the platform is built on Ethereum (currently built on PoW (proof of work) but exploring ways to change that). As described here , the reason they decided to build on the Etherium network is because of the simplicity of using it as a method of exchange. From the start, Storj was never intended to be a true \u201cdecentralized storage\u201d network. The idea was more of a ploy for distributed storage (this is further explored later in the \u201cdecentralization\u201d section) and when the team looked at their options for paying the storage providers, using something like a coin on top of Ethereum just flat out made more sense. First, they could mint money to pay for development. Then, more importantly, they could get away from centralized payment providers like Paypal which would have taken a massive chunk of their profits. In any case, if you\u2019re interested in how Eth consensus works (to get a better grasp of how Storj functions), see here . 0Chain 0Chain is the only network here that uses PoS (proof of stake). PoS was introduced in 2016 and is at the cutting edge of blockchain tech. Only a few coins have moved to it, namely Dash, Polkadot, and Stellar. The actuall details (like everything in crypto) are quite complex, but you can read about it here . Short version would look like this: Every miner that wants to take a place in the \u201cactive set\u201d of miners and sharders has to lock-up some ZCN to the network. Then, at every rotation period, some of the \u201cactive set\u201d are rotated out, and the actors with the highest stake (squared) get chosen to join the set. The miners secure the network in return for coin and the sharders aggregate old blocks and serve them to those who request them in return for coin. Because the miners are \u201ccentralized\u201d and limited to a set of thirty, transactions can be verified extremely quickly, though this does come at the cost of more trust being necessary to run the network. The big issue with PoS is the lack of resiliency, the untested nature of new tech, and the focusing of wealth at the top. If a PoS network goes down for a couple days, it likely won\u2019t come back because the nodes will never be able to settle on the true consensus. This is unlike PoW where it is very easy to verify chain weight and find consensus even after massive downtime by major shares of the network. Then there\u2019s the fact that PoS hasn\u2019t been tested thoroughly, there could be a myriad of issues that are completely unforeseen. Then of course there\u2019s my major issue with the network, the incentivized wealth inequality. In reality, it\u2019s unlikely that the network would ever go down for that long, and it\u2019s not like the code hasn\u2019t been reviewed, but the fact that the entire network\u2019s \u201cSybil protection\u201d is created in order to funnel wealth to the top just doesn\u2019t sit right with me. Also if you didn\u2019t already know, squared staking is squaring stakes to give the wealthy exponentially more influence over the network. Chains compared: Block Time Block time is how long it takes for a transactions to go through on the network. There can be a myriad of reasons to have different block times depending on what the devs want for the network, but it\u2019s good to keep in mind that the longer the block time is, the more likely it is for the network to be secure and the more ease of supporting nodes that are far apart. Filecoin Filecoin uses a variation of PoS (proof of stake), PoSt (proof of space time) as described above, the block time is thirty seconds on average. This is a bit odd to me because it\u2019s actually quite slow. Payment channels would be necessary but it still poses the issue of malicious miners screwing each-other over by propagating outdated chains. Transactions are fast, which is nice for money transfers, but to me at least, this seems like kind of the worst of both worlds. You can read more here . Sia Since Sia is very closely based of Bitcoin, the block time is also ten minutes. The network itself is not designed for fast on-chain transactions and is only really meant for three things: transacting money (of course), creating payment channels (allowing instant payments between renters and host), and verifying storage contracts. So the slow block time isn\u2019t really an issue since majority of all transactions happens in payment channels that are settled on-chain when the storage contract expires. Did anyone say lightning network? \ud83d\ude09 Storj Storj is the only \u201cdstorage\u201d solution to not employ their own chain. As described above, they decided to use the Ethereum network due to the easy deployment of a coin on it. Because of this decision the block time is twelve seconds and needs to deal with consequences of sharing blockchain with other projects. 0Chain 0Chain is interesting in this regard because it is the only chain that uses a high frequency block time and \u201csharders\u201d to handle the significant overhead of a chain that is secured with this method. Blocks occur every second or so on average, and because of this, payment channels aren\u2019t really used to pay blobbers for storage. Side note, the transaction times can be this low without issues because of the nature of PoS. While I have my qualms with PoS in general, I do recognize this as one upside to the tech. Chains compared: Enforcement of Data Retention There are many different methods that can be used to enforce data retention on data store-ers, all having their individual ups and downs. Filecoin Due to Filecoin using PoSt( proof of space time) the entire network is designed around enforcement of data retention. When uploading a chunk of storage to Filecoin, the renter has to send some money to the host, and the miner has to \u201cseal\u201d this data into something that can be easily used to prove that they continue to store this data. When sealing, some Filecoin (the token of same name) is also required to be locked up as collateral. Then, every time prompted by the network, the miner puts up a proof that it still has the original storage that it was intended to store. If successful, the miner gets to put that amount stored into it\u2019s own \u201cstorage power\u201d (which is equivalent to hash power on a PoW network), and gains block rewards for doing so (as well as the coin sent by the user at the beginning). If the miner fails to provide a valid proof, then they lose reputation and get \u201cslashed\u201d. Getting slashed means that they lose collateral. When miner fails to keep his promise, it means also that only backup of user\u2019s data was irreversibly lost since Filecoin doesn\u2019t use redundancy. Sia Sia uses a special type of smart contract called a \u201cfile contract\u201d. This file contract effectively does two things: It locks up coins from the renter and host until the \u201cproof window\u201d hits and the host can submit a proof to the network to prove that they still retain the data that the renter originally uploaded. Unlike something like Storj, there is no trust in either party, and the chain itself is the one that decides if the contract is valid or not. It facilities functions like downloading and uploading through RHPC2 (renter host protocol two) and now RHPC3 (renter host protocol three). When the contract successfully expires, host receives both the collateral and reward. Host can set the collateral to anything they want (even to nothing) but any sane host selection algorithm makes sure that the host it\u2019s using has a decent enough collateral multiplier to incentivize the host keep the data safe and always available. If the host fails to keep its promise, all locked up coins are burnt and one fragment of user\u2019s data is lost. However, thanks to redundancy there are many replacements that allow reconstructions of the fragment and re-upload to different host. Storj Unfortunately, the actual enforcement of data retention isn\u2019t super clearly documented, the best resource I\u2019ve come across is this . In essence though, each Satellite (the interface between the storage operators and the clients) does the enforcement of data retention all on their own. Each Satellite has their own subset of storage nodes that it knows have good reputation and it trusts, it uses these hosts to upload data to. Then it, on regular intervals, checks random data segments with something called \u201cBerlekamp-Welch\u201d error correction to make sure that the data is still there. If it is, nothing happens. But if it isn\u2019t there, the reputation of that host gets docked and data is migrated to a new host. It\u2019s quite simple actually. Unlike the other three options, there isn\u2019t chain-level enforcement for data retention; the Storj token is strictly a means to move value at a massive scale at low cost. So, this means that the network is relatively trusty when it comes to stuff like payments (the storage operators just have to trust the satellites will pay them). 0Chain 0Chain is quite similar to Filecoin in that the network itself ensures data retention by regularly challenging the hosts and requiring proofs. The idea of it is this though: User and \u201cblobber\u201d (hosting nodes) form an agreement on pricing for bandwidth and storage. User allocates funds to the \u201cblobber reward pool\u201d to be used for future payment. User uploads data to \u201cblobbers\u201d and money is moved from the \u201creward pool\u201d to the \u201cchallenge pool\u201d. Then the network regularly challenges the blobber and requires proofs for the data it claims to store. If the blobber provides valid proofs, the funds from the challenge pool will incrementally be moved to the host\u2019s wallet where it can use that money as it pleases. If the blobber doesn\u2019t provide valid proofs, it gets punished for it\u2019s failures and the coin gets burned. Chains compared: Content Distribution Content distribution is a bit of an oddity in the decentralized storage space for one main reason, people that want to watch videos in a browser don\u2019t want to run a full node. Though, because of the nature of the space, full nodes are necessary in order to retrieve files. Different networks take different approached to adding incentiveized middle men in order to distribute to the lay-man. Filecoin Filecoin\u2019s content distribution network is kinda odd to say the least. Since data has to be \u201csealed\u201d to be counted as provable storage to the chain, and since this takes so much computation to do or undo, it really isn\u2019t practical for the Filecoin miners to serve data. For reference, a 1MiB file can take 5-10 minuets to unseal, and a 32GiB file takes 3 hours to unseal on the minimum hardware requirements (which are 128GB of ram, 8 cores, and an SSD btw). Also, at this point IPFS (a previous project by Protocol Labs) is effectively dead development wise due to the lack of incentive structure. To address this issue, the Filecoin devs introduced a method to stored cached and unsealed versions of the data while also storing the same data as sealed in order to provide proofs to the chain. This has the obvious issue of the miner having to store double the amount of data, while also posing the problem that unless this data is frequently accessed, the miners won\u2019t store it because it won\u2019t make them money. So something like a Google Photo\u2019s equivalent on Filecoin really just isn\u2019t practical because the data is infrequent enough where it doesn\u2019t make sense to cache, while also being something that needs to be low latency (which is impossible if the data has to be sealed/unsealed often). Read more here . Sia The Sia network has had a dedicated content distribution platform for about a year now called Skynet. I delve into more detail about it here . The gist of it though is that there is a \u201cglobal file space\u201d of things called Skylinks (Skylinks are 46 character long unique identifiers based on the \u201cMerkle Tree Root\u201d of the file). Any node (Skynet nodes are called portals) can access any Skylink by pinging hosts that it is contracted with until it finds the file and can send it off to the user. There is also another layer to this called \u201cSkyDB\u201d which allows for mutable file pointers as well. The tech is new, there are things to improve and bugs to fix, but in comparison to the rest of the space it\u2019s very fleshed out. Try out Skynet here . Storj Content distribution through Storj is actually quite simple. Due to the nature of the data only being accessible through the S3 gateway of centralized data Satellites, any data can be made public, and you can send anyone a link to that data easily. The down side of this is that for network throughput to scale, you have to have Storj Labs add more Satellites to the network because the Satellite software isn\u2019t currently available to the public to set up themselves unlike Skynet Portals or 0Chain block explorer. Also, something to keep in mind is that due to Storj\u2019s fixed pricing scheme for paying hosts, the hosts have to be paid $10/TB for egress, though different front ends charge different amounts. Filebase charges $15/TB and Tardigrade charges $45/TB. So no matter what, egress will always be somewhat expensive because pricing isn\u2019t decided by a free market unlike the other three competitors. 0Chain 0Chain (as of now in the beta net) and Sia have somewhat similar approaches to content distribution. 0Chain has points to interact with the network; in essence, it is a lite wallet and renter combo. A server does all the work, keeping up with consensus and proxying traffic to the browser. All files are globally available because they are stored, proven, and maintained by the chain. The eventual goal would be for every client to run a \u201cfull node themselves\u201d (which is actually theoretically possible due to sharders dealing with the consensus portion of the network significantly reducing the load on the client), but a js/wasm is yet to see implementation. Chains compared: Sector Size Sector size is often something that is ignored or not considered by someone new to the space. Effectively, sector size is the minimum amount of data you can send to the host and pay for. Different networks call it different things, and different networks have different sizes, but in essence it\u2019s the smallest amount of payable storage. Filecoin Filecoin actually has a fixed 32GiB sector size which is quite unwieldly. Also, for each 256B, 2B are reserved for proofs. Read more here . So what would normally be a 32GiB sector(34,359,738,368B) would actually store 34,091,302,912B. This isn\u2019t a huge cost, but it does mean ~1% of storage paid for is just proofs. Also, another thing to keep in mind is that everything to be sent to a Filecoin miner must be in a car file which can be somewhat compute heavy on the client side. This is in contrast to other networks where you just send the host a binary blob and you\u2019re all good. Sia I have talked about Sia\u2019s minimum sector size at length here , but the gist is this: at a protocol level, the minimum file size is 4MiB. This is done so the metadata doesn\u2019t take up too much space on the renter (for 64B sectors, there would be a 1:2 metadata to data stored ratio). This is planned to be addressed at some point by adding a 64KiB option to sector size, but that has no planned release date. Due to the 4MiB sector size, it is not price efficient to store small files without compressing them first, but it\u2019s fine for anything else (raw photos, videos, archives). In addition to that, Skynet (Sia\u2019s layer two) allows different handling. While nothing changes for individual files (they take size of full chunk if they are smaller), a lot changes for folder uploads. Folders uploaded to Sia hosts through Skynet have their contents automatically packed into the 4 MiB chunks to allow you storing even large collections of tiny files efficiently. Storj Storj is kinda odd when it comes to sector size because of how their network infrastructure works. As described above, Storj uses a set of centralized \u201cSatellites\u201d to aggregate data and ensure up-time of data for you, but because the Satellites (which are the ingress/egress points of the network) are completely in Storj Lab\u2019s control, they can play some tricks to improve their performance in this category. For example, if the file is < 4KB then it just gets stored on the Satellites in perpetuity it never reaches the hosts. And since the insides of how Storj works aren\u2019t really known, the sector size isn\u2019t clear. What we do know though, is that the object fee is $0.0000022 per file stored. So if you were to store 1TB of 64KB files, it would cost an extra $25 roughly. Nothing spectacular, their storage cost is already $45/TB/mo through Tardigrade. Though, it seems that in their lack of decentralized-ness here they actually incurred massive cost savings. Read more here . 0Chain As described here in a comparison article by Sculptex, 0chain also has a fixed sector size of 64KiB. This is quite impressive and is small enough to the point where if most people were just to upload all of their personal files to the network, most wouldn\u2019t waste too much storage due to sector size inefficiency. Chains compared: Decentralization I\u2019ve used quotes multiple times when referring to these networks as \u201cdecentralized\u201d because some of these networks just have less decentralization that others. I\u2019ll go into more detail on what that means later on. Filecoin Something I didn\u2019t touch on earlier in this article (because it wasn\u2019t relevant to the other categories) is the absolute lunacy that is Filecoin\u2019s hardware requirements for hosts. The base hardware requirements are: 8 Core CPU 128GB RAM Beefy GPU 1TB SSD Read more here . In theory, this wouldn\u2019t actually change to what extent the network is decentralized, but you really have to think about who would actually have the resources to run a storage miner. On the other networks, basically anyone can run a storage node (most networks require at least 2 cores, 8GB of RAM and some storage), but on Filecoin, only big companies (or rich people) can run hosts. This significantly reduces the actual spread of the network, and is the reason many people (including myself) refer to Filecoin as a \u201cdecentralized marketplace for centralized providers.\u201d Also, conflating the storage providers and the miners on the network is a serious blow to decentralization because it makes only one type of machine able to participate on the network. Sia Sia, due to the heavy influence of Bitcoin, took a \u201cdecentralize at any cost\u201d approach and because of this is as decentralized as it only can be. Anyone can run any node they\u2019d like on low-end (in the crypto world at least) machines. This comes at the cost of renter having to run Sia at least once every month in order to let the software maintain file health (because trusting anyone but yourself to maintain files would cause conflict of interest) and keep the hosts on their toes, but for those that want the true decentralization it\u2019s the best option. Also, the fact that Sia is based on PoW is a good sign for those that respect the tech. It\u2019s very inefficient and wasteful by design and as such it is extremely decentralized, secure, and battle tested. Skynet is not mentioned here because it\u2019s a layer two and isn\u2019t relevant for the underlaying protocol. Actually it\u2019s closer to a open-source product built on top of Sia that utilizes Sia\u2019s features to its maximum and that anyone can run. Storj Storj is interesting in the regard of \u201cdecentralization\u201d because it really isn\u2019t decentralized. The trust in the Satellites is utmost and the blockchain nature of the Storj coin itself is only really designed for efficient transacting, not decentralized enforcement of data retention. So that really leaves Storj as great \u201cdistributed\u201d storage, allowing for greater data durability and the likes, but it\u2019s not really decentralized. Now to be fair to Storj, they really weren\u2019t aiming for \u201cfull decentralization\u201d anyway, so it\u2019s not really a big deal. But it is a good thing to keep in mind. 0Chain 0Chain is interesting in this regard because they actually did a great job in splitting up every possible role on the network. There are miners for mining coin, blobbers for storing arbitrary data, and sharders for storing consensus; this is a stark contrast to Filecoin where they made all the nodes do all the things, creating conflicts of interest. But at the same time PoS is unproven, squared staking is a funnel of wealth to the already wealthy, and the fact that KYC is required at the launch of their main-net to be a miner should make anyone with knowledge of decentralized systems seriously uncomfortable. Okay, so who wins? Earlier I definitely interwove my opinions into the writing but I tried to stay mostly informative instead of trying to spread my ideals. Here though, I\u2019m just gonna say what I believe (keep in mind that I\u2019m an active Sia community member and what I\u2019m saying is likely highly biased). I think that Storj and Filecoin should immediately be eliminated from this running. Filecoins issues are: - Transfers are egregiously slow due to the seal/unseal process. - There are conflicts of interests due to conflating miners and storage providers. - PoSt is unproven to actually be resilient against attacks - Hardware requirements are stupidly high. Storj just isn\u2019t really a decentralized storage provider . If you\u2019re in the market for distributed storage though, check out Filebase (they\u2019re a storage provider that works both on Sia and Storj for the back end). Then who wins between Sia and 0Chain? Well, right out of the gate one we have to keep in mind that 0Chain just flat out doesn\u2019t exist yet . It\u2019s currently rapidly evolving in the beta-net stage and is slated to release in Q1 of 2021. The code is all public of course, but it\u2019s not like you could begin to develop on it right now, it needs more time to mature. The promise of the chain handling contract maintenance sounds super awesome, as well as the idea of having \u201csharders\u201d handle consensus so full nodes can run on literally any hardware. But my gripes as listed above in the \u201cDecentralization\u201d section are just too great; anything in crypto that requires KYC to get a priority spot in staking in the network makes me incredibly uncomfortable. Now Sia isn\u2019t perfect in the slightest , I list a lot of problems with it here . But in the current decentralized storage space, it is the best option in my eyes. Also with developments like Skynet , the creation of the Sia Foundation , and the possibility of implementing features like Utreexo, the future looks bright for Sia. To learn more about the insides of it, read an article Danger wrote here . Honorable mentions While the only actual usable/promising chains are broken down above, it\u2019s not like they\u2019re the only ones in the space. Some other honorable mentions are as follows. Arweave Arweave gives the interesting proposition of immutable data forever stored on the blockchain. The only issue is that data isn\u2019t incentivized to stay on chain because the miners don\u2019t get paid more over time for storing the data. They only keep accruing more and more data which will, in all likely-hood, lead to a fork in a couple years to allow miners to ditch data. In my opinion, it\u2019s a bad design and cannot practically hold more than a couple KB per user and sustain itself.

Every miner looks into the transaction pool and grabs those transactions that\u2019ll make them the most money. Then they create a transaction that will give them the block reward and incorporates the last block into a new one that ensures immutability of blockchain. Every miner then repeatedly tries to \u201chash\u201d their respective newly created block with specialized hardware specific to the task called an ASIC (application specific integrated circuit). Finally, whoever gets a special number from this hash first gets to claim their block reward by broadcasting the block to network.

This is a dramatic over-simplification of PoW and I highly recommend the 3blue1brown video for those who want to understand it in more detail.

PoS was introduced in 2016 and is at the cutting edge of blockchain tech. Only a few coins have moved to it, namely Dash, Polkadot, and Stellar. The actuall details (like everything in crypto) are quite complex, but you can read about it here . Short version would look like this: Every miner that wants to take a place in the \u201cactive set\u201d of miners and sharders has to lock-up some ZCN to the network. Then, at every rotation period, some of the \u201cactive set\u201d are rotated out, and the actors with the highest stake (squared) get chosen to join the set. The miners secure the network in return for coin and the sharders aggregate old blocks and serve them to those who request them in return for coin.

If a PoS network goes down for a couple days, it likely won\u2019t come back because the nodes will never be able to settle on the true consensus. This is unlike PoW where it is very easy to verify chain weight and find consensus even after massive downtime by major shares of the network. Then there\u2019s the fact that PoS hasn\u2019t been tested thoroughly, there could be a myriad of issues that are completely unforeseen. Then of course there\u2019s my major issue with the network, the incentivized wealth inequality. In reality, it\u2019s unlikely that the network would ever go down for that long, and it\u2019s not like the code hasn\u2019t been reviewed, but the fact that the entire network\u2019s \u201cSybil protection\u201d is created in order to funnel wealth to the top just doesn\u2019t sit right with me.

When uploading a chunk of storage to Filecoin, the renter has to send some money to the host, and the miner has to \u201cseal\u201d this data into something that can be easily used to prove that they continue to store this data. When sealing, some Filecoin (the token of same name) is also required to be locked up as collateral. Then, every time prompted by the network, the miner puts up a proof that it still has the original storage that it was intended to store. If successful, the miner gets to put that amount stored into it\u2019s own \u201cstorage power\u201d (which is equivalent to hash power on a PoW network), and gains block rewards for doing so (as well as the coin sent by the user at the beginning). If the miner fails to provide a valid proof, then they lose reputation and get \u201cslashed\u201d. Getting slashed means that they lose collateral.

Unlike something like Storj, there is no trust in either party, and the chain itself is the one that decides if the contract is valid or not. It facilities functions like downloading and uploading through RHPC2 (renter host protocol two) and now RHPC3 (renter host protocol three). When the contract successfully expires, host receives both the collateral and reward. Host can set the collateral to anything they want (even to nothing) but any sane host selection algorithm makes sure that the host it\u2019s using has a decent enough collateral multiplier to incentivize the host keep the data safe and always available.

Each Satellite has their own subset of storage nodes that it knows have good reputation and it trusts, it uses these hosts to upload data to. Then it, on regular intervals, checks random data segments with something called \u201cBerlekamp-Welch\u201d error correction to make sure that the data is still there. If it is, nothing happens. But if it isn\u2019t there, the reputation of that host gets docked and data is migrated to a new host. It\u2019s quite simple actually.

Since data has to be \u201csealed\u201d to be counted as provable storage to the chain, and since this takes so much computation to do or undo, it really isn\u2019t practical for the Filecoin miners to serve data. For reference, a 1MiB file can take 5-10 minuets to unseal, and a 32GiB file takes 3 hours to unseal on the minimum hardware requirements (which are 128GB of ram, 8 cores, and an SSD btw). Also, at this point IPFS (a previous project by Protocol Labs) is effectively dead development wise due to the lack of incentive structure. To address this issue, the Filecoin devs introduced a method to stored cached and unsealed versions of the data while also storing the same data as sealed in order to provide proofs to the chain. This has the obvious issue of the miner having to store double the amount of data, while also posing the problem that unless this data is frequently accessed, the miners won\u2019t store it because it won\u2019t make them money. So something like a Google Photo\u2019s equivalent on Filecoin really just isn\u2019t practical because the data is infrequent enough where it doesn\u2019t make sense to cache, while also being something that needs to be low latency (which is impossible if the data has to be sealed/unsealed often).

This is planned to be addressed at some point by adding a 64KiB option to sector size, but that has no planned release date. Due to the 4MiB sector size, it is not price efficient to store small files without compressing them first, but it\u2019s fine for anything else (raw photos, videos, archives). In addition to that, Skynet (Sia\u2019s layer two) allows different handling.

I think that Storj and Filecoin should immediately be eliminated from this running. Filecoins issues are: - Transfers are egregiously slow due to the seal/unseal process. - There are conflicts of interests due to conflating miners and storage providers. - PoSt is unproven to actually be resilient against attacks - Hardware requirements are stupidly high.

Last update: March 31, 2021 | Sia 1.5.5 Wallet Where can I store SC? We have a dedicated guide for that here . Cannot send or receive Siacoin (SC) Since there is no centralized server you can ask for current balance in the decentralized network like Sia, each user has their own copy of the blockchain that he must sync with and verify. This means your wallet can show and work only with results based on the data you already have and synced. If you cannot see incoming transaction but it is visible in blockchain explorer like siastats , it means the transaction is already yours, you are just not synced to the Sia blockchain. You are synced to wrong blockchain, which is common issue for returning users who missed the 2018 fork and launched version older than 1.3.7 before checking for update. That got you to a situation where you synced past the point of automatic resolution and are trying to sync blocks from incompatible blockchain, which new versions of Sia won\u2019t accept. You will see correct balance once you re-sync to Sia blockchain. See instructions how to re-sync. If you sent transaction but it never arrived in the other wallet , you also most likely cannot see it in the blockchain explorer like siastats . If this is the case, you didn\u2019t send Siacoin (SC). You are synced to wrong blockchain for same reason as explained above. Instead of SC you sent the coins on the legacy blockchain and that\u2019s why other Sia users and exchanges cannot detect it. This transaction never happened on Sia network which means that once you re-sync, you will still find the coins in your wallet. You can follow these instructions to re-sync. If you cannot send a transaction and it shows nothing after clicking the \u201cSend\u201d button, you are maybe trying to send full balance. Try it again but send 0.5 SC less. This is needed since the wallet is not counting transaction fees in the transaction. The fees are paid from the remaining SC inn your wallet so it is good idea to always leave some tiny amount (1 SC or less) instead of sending it all. If this doesn\u2019t help, try cleaning up your transaction pool . You might want to know that Sia Foundation is going to work on Utreexo this year (2021), a feature that will dramatically reduce blockchain requirements, so you will be able to sync nearly instantly and without gigabytes of data. This will open way towards easy to use lite wallets and apps accessing Sia directly from a node running on any of your devices. How do I re-sync the Sia blockchain? If you find yourself on wrong blockchain (most commonly you notice because of wrong balance or any issue with sending/receiving coins), all you need to do is: Windows: %UserProfile%\\AppData\\Roaming\\Sia-UI\\sia\\ Linux: ~/.config/Sia-UI/sia/ Mac: ~/Library/Application Support/Sia-UI/sia/ 1. Open Sia Data Folder (either manually using location above or from the `About` section accessed by `i` button). 2. Make sure Sia is not running and then delete `consensus` and `transactionpool`. 3. Re-launch Sia and wait until you are 100% synced before trying to send anything. This is especially important if you have any recent missing transactions. They are at the end of blockchain and you won\u2019t see them until nearly 100% synced. How do I clean the transaction pool? Windows: %UserProfile%\\AppData\\Roaming\\Sia-UI\\sia Linux: ~/.config/Sia-UI/sia/ Mac: ~/Library/Application Support/Sia-UI/sia/ 1. Open Sia Data Folder (either manually using location above or from the `About` section accessed by `i` button. 2. Make sure Sia is not running and then delete `transactionpool` folder. 3. Re-launch Sia and give it some time to rebuild it. It can take few minutes or a bit longer depending on if you whave SSD or HDD. How do I perform clean installation of Sia? Windows: %UserProfile%\\AppData\\Roaming\\Sia-UI\\sia Linux: ~/.config/Sia-UI/sia/ Mac: ~/Library/Application Support/Sia-UI/sia/ 1. Open Sia Data Folder (either manually using location above or from the About section accessed by i button. 2. Make sure Sia is not running and then rename entire the sia folder to sia_backup for example. 3. Make sure you are running latest version. If not, update. 4. Re-launch Sia and wait until you are 100% synced before trying anything. 5. Load wallet from a seed (or create new wallet, depending on what you want). Once you are done, remember that in order to unlock the wallet you need to enter your seed again. 6. Give it some time. On some computers it can sometimes take up to an hour to display correct balance. Your 29-word seed is the default password and you need to enter it into password field after each recovery. You can change your password then but remember, the custom password is always just local one \u2013 protecting the wallet data in this specific computer. If you lose your seed, your only chance to get it again is if you still have the wallet data and used a custom password. If you know it, you can unlock the wallet and let it display your seed again. However, it\u2019s better to be careful and remember that seed is the only thing you will ever need for recovery. How can I sync faster? This is not recommended, since you rely on third party\u2019s consensus, but if you don\u2019t have SSD, you would wait up to a week just to get through the initial sync (further syncing will be fast) because you have several years of transactions to catch up. In such case you can follow these instructions to bootstrap consensus. How to move Sia data folder to different location? Windows: %UserProfile%\\AppData\\Roaming\\Sia-UI\\sia Linux: ~/.config/Sia-UI/sia/ Mac: ~/Library/Application Support/Sia-UI/sia/ This is useful when you need to move from HDD to SSD in order to make syncing faster. 1. Go to the folder above and copy entire `sia/` folder to a new location on your SSD 2. Launch Sia-UI, go to the settings and change the Sia Data folder location to the new one. 3. App will restart and if you did everything correctly, it will display the same stuff as before, but using new location. After that you can safely remove the original folder (only the `sia/` that you moved, do not delete anything else higher in the hierarchy) to save up some space. If it doesn\u2019t work, check the location and make sure it is correct. Is there any HW Wallet integration? Yes, there is official one using `Ledger Nano S`, but we do not recommend to use it since it is for advanced users only. Instead, we recommend you to check out the Sia Central Lite wallet . Works with any browser and allows you to use your `Ledger Nano S`. We see it as currently best possible experience for anyone looking to hold SC. If you want to do more, rent or host, you will need to run full node and download Sia-UI. Unfortunately, there is no support that developers could use to integrate it with other options as newer Ledger, Trezor and other HW Wallets. Why do I see tiny outgoing transactions? These are around 0.1 SC and usually appear when you had many incoming transactions, which is common when renting, hosting or mining. Sia-UI automatically consolidates these in order to make future transactions more efficient. It makes sense, using one output is much more efficient than using hundreds. There is nothing to be concerned about and no way to avoid it. Fundamentals What is the difference between Sia and Skynet? Sia and Skynet are part of the same software, but with different goals. You can see Sia as a `decentralized cloud storage layer`. Its complex solution that allows us to access data storage without any need for trust. It gives control back to user and individuals. Skynet is different. It is a `censorship-resistant publishing platform`. It is like decentralized internet that fully utilizes everything that Sia makes possible and uses it as its storage layer. Since it is using the same tools, the data are stored on the same hosts, but in a different way that allows content pinning, easy sharing, even entire app/site hosting without need for server. And it also allows access to SkyDB, decentralized mutable database. Anything uploaded has own Skylink that you can share. Where can I find Sia whitepaper? You can find it right here . However, keep in mind that Sia did a lot of progress since invention and if you want to better understand how it works, check out our up to date guides like Introduction to Sia . Where is the Sia roadmap? After the establishment of Sia Foundation in January 2021, the place to go to view, discuss and propose new and planned features is the Sia Forum . If you are interested in what\u2019s planned for Skynet. Best places to watch are Sia discord , SiaSky.net and of course our **Sky Guide**.

If not maintained, the renter module can be quite a pain to deal with, and the most common issue is the allowance running out. So, when you create a renter node, you set an \u201callowance\u201d that basically says, \u201crenter, you can do whatever you want besides go over this allotted amount of money(in SC). Small issue with that though, the user generally doesn\u2019t know the best number to put in here. Put the allowance too high, the renter node will frivolously spend and waste money on big contracts. Too low? The node will run out of funds and lock up. A good ballpark can to put in 3x the monthly price that is listed on Siastats , but even that is a estimate and can become inaccurate within weeks due to the \u201cmarketplace\u201d nature of Sia. So what are the side-effects of a mismanaged allowance? Downloads will cease to work properly Contract count will drop As it dwindles, siad will struggle with host churn as it trys to form contracts with cheaper and cheaper hosts. Okay, so how do you diagnose this issue? I\u2019m going to be using Sia-UI to show this example, but it\u2019s applicable to the cli interface btw. So go to the \u201cterminal\u201d button: Then type in `siac renter -v`. You\u2019ll get something that looks like this at the top of the long output: So let me break down the 3 main catigories: Spent funds Unspent funds-Allocated Unspent funds-Unallocated Spent funds Spent funds are funds that have already been signed off in the payment channel with the host(see renting ). These are funds that have been spent and the host now effectively has, assuming they can provide a storage proof in the proof window. Unspent funds-Allocated These funds are funds that have been locked into a contract and have been not been spent yet. These are put here because you needs funds to use on the fly when adding more storage or paying for download bandwidth. But if these aren\u2019t ever spent, they will get returned at the end of the contract period. Unspent funds-Unallocated This is where the issues mostly arise. If this section goes unfunded, new contracts cannot be formed and heavily used contracts cannot be refilled. This causes a myriad of issues with the renter so make sure to keep the unallocated category topped off by routinely checking it and upping the allowance as need be. One more thing to keep in mind is that it may say that you have \u201c700 H\u201d or whatever, but H means hasting which is actually 1e-24 SC.

Hosts are the backbone of the Sia network, they are a critical part of the Sia ecosystem. Hosts sell their storage space and bandwidth in exchange for Siacoin. Without hosts, renters would not be able to store data and Skynet would not be able to function. Hosting requires a basic level of technical knowledge. Hosts need to be familiar with basic port forwarding, firewall rules, disk management, along with some concepts unique to Sia\u2019s decentralized storage model. Uptime Hosting is a commitment. Ideally hosts would be available 24/7, but some downtime is expected. Over 85% uptime is acceptable for most renters. It is important that hosts are available as much as possible to give renters access to their data and earn revenue. Failing to fulfill storage commitments can cause the host to lose Siacoin. Hardware Requirements Sia is able to run on a variety of different devices, architectures, and operating systems. Sia has official releases for Windows, Mac, and Linux. There are hosts running on low power devices like Raspberry Pi\u2019s all the way up to high power rack mount servers. requirements cores memory SSD Disk Space OS Minimum Requirements 2 cores 4GB Memory 60GB SSD 4TB HDD Whatever Recommended Requirements 4 cores 8GB memory 256GB SSD 4TB HDD Linux It is highly recommended to store Sia\u2019s blockchain (20GB+) and metadata on an SSD for better speeds. Renter data can be stored on normal consumer HDD to maximize space and minimize costs. Sia is optimized to run on Linux, other operating systems will work but come with trade-offs or increased risk. Wallet Balance Hosts need to keep their wallet\u2019s topped up with Siacoin in order to submit storage proofs and form new contracts. Due to how contract payouts work, mosts hosts are locking more collateral than they have incoming, it can take up to a year before the host has enough expiring contracts to self-sustain off only their earned revenue. Usually around $10 USD in SC is enough for new hosts to get up and running, but it largely depends on the host\u2019s pricing and collateral. Earning Revenue Hosts earn revenue by providing storage and bandwidth to renters. Renters pay for this usage in Siacoin. At the end of the contract earned revenue is automatically sent to the host\u2019s wallet. If a contract is formed for 3 months the host will be payed only after the contract has expired. There are currently two bugs which make tracking revenue very difficult: host revenue does not show up in Sia\u2019s transaction list and Sia\u2019s built in revenue totals are inaccurate. Combined, this makes tracking earned revenue extremely difficult since host\u2019s often lock up more collateral than they earn in revenue. Risking Collateral To incentivize hosts to remain online long term, hosts are expected to risk collateral for the data they are storing. If a host cannot prove they have stored the data they have agreed to their collateral and payment is burned. This keeps hosts accountable and incentivized. Most hosts have found that between 1 and 2 times storage price is a good balance of collateral for earning the most revenue. Storage Proofs At the end of a contract the host has the option to submit a storage proof. This is proof that the host stored the data they were expected to for the contract\u2019s duration. After the expiration of a contract, the host has 24 hours (144 blocks) to submit a storage proof during the proof window . If the host does not submit a storage proof the host\u2019s risked collateral and the renter\u2019s spent allowance is burned. In most instances it is in the host\u2019s best interest to submit a storage proof, but there are some cases where submitting a proof would not make sense. If the cost of submitting a storage proof is greater than the host\u2019s potential loss the host will not submit a proof. Contracts Contracts create an instant payment channel between a host and renter that allows the renter to quickly pay for storage and bandwidth usage. Contracts are blockchain enforced agreements between a host and renter that automatically resolve at the end of the contracting period. This keeps the entire ecosystem working transparently and honestly. The host and renter both lock Siacoin into a contract for the entire duration. When a contract is created the renter and host agree on how much allowance the renter should lock in, how much collateral the host should lock in, and how long the contract is for. Revenue, unspent allowance, and collateral is automatically returned to its owner at the end of the contracting period. The host has some controls to block unfavorable contracts. Renters decide the duration of the contract and how much collateral the host should lock for the data they want to store, but the host can limit how much collateral they are willing to lock into a single contract and the maximum duration of the contract. Max Duration is the maximum duration that a contract can be for. This is usually represented in months. The average duration is around 3 months. Hosts are payed only at the end of the contract duration. If a host commits to storing data for 6 months, but fails to submit a storage proof all revenue and collateral will be burned. Max Collateral is the maximum amount of collateral a host is willing to lock into a single contract. Large contracts can cause performance issues on hosts and locking too much collateral into a single contract may limit the number of contracts a host can form with other renters. Collateral Budget the total amount of Siacoin to use for forming contracts. This is currently bugged so the budget can fill up without actually having collateral locked. Setting this to a very high number regardless of wallet balance can help to reduce unnecessary restarts. Pricing Hosts get to set their own prices, the storage marketplace is meant to be a free and open competition between hosts to provide the best value to renters. Historically, there has been much more supply than demand so profits are low. This isn\u2019t to say that hosts can\u2019t earn a small profit. Hosts with good reputations or better connections are often chosen even if the cost would be higher. Storage Price is the cost to store data on the host, usually represented as SC per terabyte per month. Around $1 \u2013 $2 USD per TB is a good starting price Download Bandwidth Price is the cost to download data from the host, otherwise known as egress , usually represented as SC per terabyte. Between $1 \u2013 $5 USD per TB is a good starting price. In a more competitive market it might make sense to charge more if you have a Gigabit connection with no data cap or are in a location with few hosts. Upload Bandwidth Price is the cost to upload data to the host, otherwise known as ingress . Usually this is represented as SC per terabyte. Onboarding data is the most important part of hosting, it is generally recommended to set this low or even to 0 to onboard as much data as possible. Collateral is the amount of collateral the host needs to risk per TB of data stored. Between 1 \u2013 2 times storage price is a good reference point. Contract Price is the cost to form a contract with the host, this should not be more than 1 SC . Contract price is meant to cover transaction fees for submitting a storage proof. The default 0.15 SC is for the most part fine, most storage proofs cost less than 0.01 SC to submit. Announcements Hosts are required to announce either an IP address or DNS address where renters can connect to them. The announcement has four parts: the ip/domain, the port to connect on, the host\u2019s public key, and a signature. This makes it easy for renters to discover and connect with new hosts and update existing hosts. Announcing a DNS like myhost.hosting.com:9982 instead of an IP address avoids having to announce multiple times if you do not have a static IP. Ranking Most renters rank hosts based on criteria they find important. There is no centralized ranking system for hosts, each renter uniquely ranks hosts they can connect with based on different criteria. For the most part a host\u2019s individual rank can be very different between two renters. The original Sia renter ranks hosts based on age, pricing, collateral ratio, available storage, and estimated uptime. When picking new hosts to store data with the renter does not necessarily pick in order of rank. As such, Sia rank should not be considered an important metric for hosts. To break the top 50 a host would need to sacrifice most of their revenue potential. Custom scoring systems that take into account transfer speed, availability and latency over pricing are also being used.

Hosts sell their storage space and bandwidth in exchange for Siacoin. Without hosts, renters would not be able to store data and Skynet would not be able to function.

Hosts need to be familiar with basic port forwarding, firewall rules, disk management, along with some concepts unique to Sia\u2019s decentralized storage model.","title":"Hosting?"},{"location":"hosting/index.html#uptime","text":"Hosting is a commitment. Ideally hosts would be available 24/7, but some downtime is expected. Over 85% uptime is acceptable for most renters. It is important that hosts are available as much as possible to give renters access to their data and earn revenue. Failing to fulfill storage commitments can cause the host to lose Siacoin.","title":"Uptime"},{"location":"hosting/index.html#hardware-requirements","text":"Sia is able to run on a variety of different devices, architectures, and operating systems.

Renter data can be stored on normal consumer HDD to maximize space and minimize costs. Sia is optimized to run on Linux, other operating systems will work but come with trade-offs or increased risk.","title":"Hardware Requirements"},{"location":"hosting/index.html#wallet-balance","text":"Hosts need to keep their wallet\u2019s topped up with Siacoin in order to submit storage proofs and form new contracts. Due to how contract payouts work, mosts hosts are locking more collateral than they have incoming, it can take up to a year before the host has enough expiring contracts to self-sustain off only their earned revenue. Usually around $10 USD in SC is enough for new hosts to get up and running, but it largely depends on the host\u2019s pricing and collateral.","title":"Wallet Balance"},{"location":"hosting/index.html#earning-revenue","text":"Hosts earn revenue by providing storage and bandwidth to renters. Renters pay for this usage in Siacoin. At the end of the contract earned revenue is automatically sent to the host\u2019s wallet. If a contract is formed for 3 months the host will be payed only after the contract has expired. There are currently two bugs which make tracking revenue very difficult: host revenue does not show up in Sia\u2019s transaction list and Sia\u2019s built in revenue totals are inaccurate. Combined, this makes tracking earned revenue extremely difficult since host\u2019s often lock up more collateral than they earn in revenue.","title":"Earning Revenue"},{"location":"hosting/index.html#risking-collateral","text":"To incentivize hosts to remain online long term, hosts are expected to risk collateral for the data they are storing. If a host cannot prove they have stored the data they have agreed to their collateral and payment is burned. This keeps hosts accountable and incentivized. Most hosts have found that between 1 and 2 times storage price is a good balance of collateral for earning the most revenue.","title":"Risking Collateral"},{"location":"hosting/index.html#storage-proofs","text":"At the end of a contract the host has the option to submit a storage proof. This is proof that the host stored the data they were expected to for the contract\u2019s duration. After the expiration of a contract, the host has 24 hours (144 blocks) to submit a storage proof during the proof window . If the host does not submit a storage proof the host\u2019s risked collateral and the renter\u2019s spent allowance is burned. In most instances it is in the host\u2019s best interest to submit a storage proof, but there are some cases where submitting a proof would not make sense. If the cost of submitting a storage proof is greater than the host\u2019s potential loss the host will not submit a proof.","title":"Storage Proofs"},{"location":"hosting/index.html#contracts","text":"Contracts create an instant payment channel between a host and renter that allows the renter to quickly pay for storage and bandwidth usage. Contracts are blockchain enforced agreements between a host and renter that automatically resolve at the end of the contracting period. This keeps the entire ecosystem working transparently and honestly. The host and renter both lock Siacoin into a contract for the entire duration. When a contract is created the renter and host agree on how much allowance the renter should lock in, how much collateral the host should lock in, and how long the contract is for. Revenue, unspent allowance, and collateral is automatically returned to its owner at the end of the contracting period. The host has some controls to block unfavorable contracts. Renters decide the duration of the contract and how much collateral the host should lock for the data they want to store, but the host can limit how much collateral they are willing to lock into a single contract and the maximum duration of the contract. Max Duration is the maximum duration that a contract can be for. This is usually represented in months. The average duration is around 3 months. Hosts are payed only at the end of the contract duration. If a host commits to storing data for 6 months, but fails to submit a storage proof all revenue and collateral will be burned. Max Collateral is the maximum amount of collateral a host is willing to lock into a single contract. Large contracts can cause performance issues on hosts and locking too much collateral into a single contract may limit the number of contracts a host can form with other renters. Collateral Budget the total amount of Siacoin to use for forming contracts. This is currently bugged so the budget can fill up without actually having collateral locked. Setting this to a very high number regardless of wallet balance can help to reduce unnecessary restarts.","title":"Contracts"},{"location":"hosting/index.html#pricing","text":"Hosts get to set their own prices, the storage marketplace is meant to be a free and open competition between hosts to provide the best value to renters. Historically, there has been much more supply than demand so profits are low. This isn\u2019t to say that hosts can\u2019t earn a small profit. Hosts with good reputations or better connections are often chosen even if the cost would be higher. Storage Price is the cost to store data on the host, usually represented as SC per terabyte per month. Around $1 \u2013 $2 USD per TB is a good starting price Download Bandwidth Price is the cost to download data from the host, otherwise known as egress , usually represented as SC per terabyte. Between $1 \u2013 $5 USD per TB is a good starting price. In a more competitive market it might make sense to charge more if you have a Gigabit connection with no data cap or are in a location with few hosts. Upload Bandwidth Price is the cost to upload data to the host, otherwise known as ingress . Usually this is represented as SC per terabyte. Onboarding data is the most important part of hosting, it is generally recommended to set this low or even to 0 to onboard as much data as possible. Collateral is the amount of collateral the host needs to risk per TB of data stored. Between 1 \u2013 2 times storage price is a good reference point. Contract Price is the cost to form a contract with the host, this should not be more than 1 SC . Contract price is meant to cover transaction fees for submitting a storage proof.

This article will make you aware of these issues while also offering another view. One, where many developers and community members are working hard to make our decentralized dream into reality. One, where there are not always the resources needed to get it done as soon as we would hope. But to be fair, other projects in the \u201cdecentralized\u201d space have much worse issues, very often not only being technically wrong, but fundamentally. And it seems that even with many times higher funding, it\u2019s not about the money. It is about how it works\u2026 and in this matter, Sia keeps moving unstoppably forward. Renting Below are a couple of things to consider before renting. Minimum File Size The minimum file size is 40MB . This is due to erasure coding and the minimum sector size on Sia. If you are trying to store a bunch of small files like a photos, songs or documents, either archive them together or don\u2019t use Sia to store/back them up. If you were to store a bunch of 4KB files, you\u2019d be over spending by over 1000x. To learn more about why, read here. Only One Computer at a Time A Sia node can only be used on one computer at a time due to how file contracts work, so don\u2019t expect a full dropbox-esque experience of having it on every device at once. Blockchain vs. Smaller Devices In order to sync the blockchain, you must download and maintain a ~22GB consensus file which makes a full Sia node completely impractical to run on anything but a mid-to-high tier desktop computer. This means you won\u2019t be running a Sia node on your phone anytime soon . One way around this issue is to use Luke Champine\u2019s us (see here ). It allows you to use something called a shard node which can run the consensus on a remote server for many clients at the same time, thus shifting the load away from the edge clients. In such case you have to depend on centralized server, even if it\u2019s yours. Another future option is the planned implementation of Utreexo , which would effectively allow you to run a full node but instead of having to store the whole chain history, you\u2019d only have to store the chain state (which would be around 50 KB). This would be great, but due to the Sia Foundation being in its infancy, I wouldn\u2019t expect Utreexo to be complete till at earliest 2022. Backups are Unreliable If you are to run your node continuously and you never run into any bugs (which actually aren\u2019t too common in siad ), you likely will never lose a single file over any period of time when renting on Sia. Only issue is, it isn\u2019t exactly practical to constantly run something like a Sia renter node and this is where backups come into play. The renter node can be backed up in two ways: Back up the renter folder. Backups of the renter/ folder become completely useless if any of the contracts are updated. That means uploading a file, downloading a file, etc will make your backup meaningless. This is due to the nature of the host and renter having to have synced contracts, so if they fall out of sync, you can\u2019t do anything with the contracts anymore. Take a contract snapshot to take advantage of seed based file recovery. Seed based file recovery is currently unreliable. It is quoted as 95% reliable by the devs, but some users can less lucky experience. Though even if it does work, it only saves a contract snapshot and cannot be deleted. So if you upload a file after the snapshot, it cannot be recovered. Covalent: \u201cI cannot speak on others experiences, but in my personal experience seed based file recovery has a reliability of 50% at best. It SHOULD NOT be relied upon for important data, treat it as a nice to have, not a foundation to rely on.\u201d While Sia Foundation is expected to address this, it might take some time. Until then, if you are looking for something more reliable, one such way is to use Skynet or some of the apps built with it . Development of Sia-UI The community understands that developers started this all with good intentions but also for profit. Investors backing up development expect some results which made it difficult to justify development of features that do not directly bring results as for example Skynet can. This is the main reason why the team didn\u2019t have much time for Sia-UI in 2020 and why some things were seen as a priority over things mentioned above. In order to change this unfortunate state of the community and the devs being at odds, as well as give Sia-UI and other participants of Sia\u2019s ecosystem some love and features they deserve, Sia Foundation was created. The Skynet Team doesn\u2019t have much time for anything but Skynet, but luckily the head of the Foundation, Luke Champine, is quoted saying that they will be hiring a UI dev within the year to work on applications like Sia-UI, so that's exciting. There are other option to store your data in the meantime though, namely: Skynet , Filebase , Storewise . Though, you have to keep in mind that they are effectively centralized service providers with a dash of decentralization, not the same fully-permissionless-ness of Sia-UI. Storing Less Than 1TB isn\u2019t practical Due to the contract formation fees of contracting hosts, if you\u2019re storing less than 1TB of data, you will end up spending the pricing is inflated greatly. This is becase you need to form some number of contracts no matter how much you plan to store and the more you store, the smaller part of your overall expenses will be spent on contract forming.

Also if you want to learn the technical details to how renting works, make sure to check out the renting article that I also wrote. Renting on Windows 10 with Sia-UI So first off you\u2019re gonna want to head to the official Sia website . And head to the download page. Then from there download the linux binary. Note, if you would like to compile it from the source, you can find the daemon code here , and the UI code here . But in all likely-hood if you can do that, you don\u2019t need this article ;p Now click on the .exe file that has been downloaded. Now linux doesn\u2019t like cryto apps at all. So linux will automatically block the file when you try to open it. Thankfully, it\u2019s easy to get around. Just click \u201cmore info\u201d And then \u201cRun Anyway\u201d Now let it run with administrator privileges. Once that is open you\u2019ll either want to put in your own seed, or generate a new one. For this article we will be creating a new seed. Also, side note say what a seed is. A seed is effectively your \u201cpassword.\u201d Though unlike normal passwords it\u2019s a cryptographic private key that all your data is encrypted with and cannot be changed. For a more detailed breakdown of how seeds work and how to keep yours secure, read here . Now you will be given a seed that is your unique identifier. DO NOT share this with anyone. If they have this seed, they have all of your SC and your data isn\u2019t safe. For more info read here . So now save this seed to a safe place and click \u201cnext\u201d Now fill in the missing words and click \u201cDone\u201d Now that you have done that you will see this. Before you bootstrap you\u2019re going to want to send some coins to your wallet. Sending coins takes(on average) an hour, so getting it out of the way now is best. So to get an address to send the coins to, click \u201cGo to Dashboard\u201d Then click on \u201cwallet\u201d Then click on \u201cReceive\u201d Then click on \u201cGenerate new Address\u201d Your new address will now show up under the \u201cLatest Address\u201d tab: Now you are going to want to acquire some Siacoin and send them to this newly generated address. For more info on how, check out the here . Also now is a good time to figure out how much Siacoin(I will further refer to it as SC from now on) you actually need. The best metric to go off is the storage pricing on Siastats , just take that pricing per TB in SC and multiply it by how many TB you need. Also keep in mind that since it costs money to form contracts with hosts(read more here ), prices will be very high until about 1TB where it levels off to average pricing. Once you send coin to your wallet you have two choices, bootstrapping and letting it sync naturally. Syncing naturally \u2013 This basically is just your node asking other nodes on the network for the history of all transactions one by one and it builds the consensus database on this. On a computer with a good connection, and SSD, and a beefy processor, it can take around 6 hours to sync. On a computer with worse hardware in general and an HDD, it can take 1-2 days to sync fully. Bootstrapping \u2013 Instead of letting your node communicate to other nodes and build the consensus itself, you download someone else\u2019s consensus file to speed up the download and build process. This is only practical if you actually trust the person that you will be bootstrapping from. A borked consensus file can have security implications. On a computer with a good connection, hardware, and an SSD, it takes 1-2 hours to bootstrap, and with a HDD it takes ~6 hours. This tutorial will be using the bootstrap method to sync because I don\u2019t want to waste too much of my time XD. In order to bootstrap, force close Sia-UI like this: Now download the consensus file from a trusted community website(for the we\u2019ll be using Siastats ). So head to Siastats and scroll to the bottom of the homepage. Then click \u201cConsensus Download\u201d Now, click on the \u201cbootrap.zip\u201d This is quite a large file and can take a long while to download. When zipped, it\u2019s about ~11GB of storage, and once decompressed(how it has to be when in use) it takes up ~22GB currently(this grows over time). This large consensus size is being worked on actively by the Sia Foundation as of now and likely in 2021/2022 there will be an implementation that allows you to run a full node with only a 50KB Utreexo chain state file. Now you have to navigate to the Sia folder so you can replace the consensus.db file with the bootstrap one. So to do that, press win + r to open the run window and type in %appdata%\\Sia-UI\\sia\\consensus . Open the bootstrap zip file and drag it into the consensus folder. Now that that is complete, open Sia-UI. And now we wait. One may ask, \u201cwhat is it doing right now?\u201d Well, despite having the consensus caught up, all of the other modules have not caught up. So it is effectively scanning through all previous blocks to fill out the other databases it uses. On a computer with a beefy CPU and SSD, it takes ~1 hour to sync up, and on a weaker computer with an HDD, it can take around ~6 hours. Now that it has loaded, you have to put your seed back in and click \u201cunlock\u201d To begin renting go to the \u201cRent\u201d tab Then, based on the Siastats pricing(I\u2019d generally recommend taking the storage pricing on Siastats and multiplying it by 1.5), you\u2019re gonna want to set your allowance to that. Click on \u201cSetup Allowance\u201d So go to the \u201cAdvanced\u201d tab for a tad more control. Now that you\u2019re in the tab, you can edit the \u201cAllowance Funds\u201d in accordance to as described earlier, \u201cExpected Storage\u201d in accordance to how much you want to store, \u201cExpected Download\u201d to however much you presume you will download, and \u201cExpected Upload\u201d to roughly the same as expected storage(because you have to upload the data you store of course). Keep in mind that the allowance is kinda fluid so you can always increase it later with no issues. Also, if you don\u2019t put in enough funds, you will run out and not be able to download files anymore once uploaded(to troubleshoot common issues, see here ). Make sure to keep hosts set to 50, the contract period to three months, and the renew period to one month. To learn more about the technical side of how renting functions and why they must be set to this, see here . Now that the allowance has been set, the final waiting game will commence. Only 10 contracts can be formed per block(each block takes 10 minuets to occur on average, too see the latest blocks see Siastats ). So to form the 50 contracts required to rent, it generally will take about an hour. You can begin to upload data at the 30 contract mark, but it will be very slow until it reaches 50 contracts. Now that you have formed 50 contracts, you can begin to upload files by dragging creating a folder by right clicking and hitting \u201cCreate Folder\u201d Then name a folder and click \u201cCreate\u201d Now once in the folder, click on the up arrow and select a file with the file picker: Give that a bit of time to upload Side note, the minimum file size on Sia is 40MB and the redundancy of siac (the underlying code that Sia-UI uses) is 3x, so no matter how small the file is, it takes up 40MB of paid space and 120MB of paid upload bandwidth to send it to three hosts.

Also if you want to learn the technical details to how renting works, make sure to check out the renting article that I also wrote. Renting on Windows 10 with Sia-UI So first off you\u2019re gonna want to head to the official Sia website . And head to the download page. Then from there download the linux binary. Note, if you would like to compile it from the source, you can find the daemon code here , and the UI code here . But in all likely-hood if you can do that, you don\u2019t need this article ;p Now click on the .exe file that has been downloaded. Now linux doesn\u2019t like cryto apps at all. So linux will automatically block the file when you try to open it. Thankfully, it\u2019s easy to get around. Just click \u201cmore info\u201d And then \u201cRun Anyway\u201d Now let it run with administrator privileges. Once that is open you\u2019ll either want to put in your own seed, or generate a new one. For this article we will be creating a new seed. Also, side note say what a seed is. A seed is effectively your \u201cpassword.\u201d Though unlike normal passwords it\u2019s a cryptographic private key that all your data is encrypted with and cannot be changed. For a more detailed breakdown of how seeds work and how to keep yours secure, read here . Now you will be given a seed that is your unique identifier. DO NOT share this with anyone. If they have this seed, they have all of your SC and your data isn\u2019t safe. For more info read here . So now save this seed to a safe place and click \u201cnext\u201d Now fill in the missing words and click \u201cDone\u201d Now that you have done that you will see this. Before you bootstrap you\u2019re going to want to send some coins to your wallet. Sending coins takes(on average) an hour, so getting it out of the way now is best. So to get an address to send the coins to, click \u201cGo to Dashboard\u201d Then click on \u201cwallet\u201d Then click on \u201cReceive\u201d Then click on \u201cGenerate new Address\u201d Your new address will now show up under the \u201cLatest Address\u201d tab: Now you are going to want to acquire some Siacoin and send them to this newly generated address. For more info on how, check out the here . Also now is a good time to figure out how much Siacoin(I will further refer to it as SC from now on) you actually need. The best metric to go off is the storage pricing on Siastats , just take that pricing per TB in SC and multiply it by how many TB you need. Also keep in mind that since it costs money to form contracts with hosts(read more here ), prices will be very high until about 1TB where it levels off to average pricing. Once you send coin to your wallet you have two choices, bootstrapping and letting it sync naturally. Syncing naturally \u2013 This basically is just your node asking other nodes on the network for the history of all transactions one by one and it builds the consensus database on this. On a computer with a good connection, and SSD, and a beefy processor, it can take around 6 hours to sync. On a computer with worse hardware in general and an HDD, it can take 1-2 days to sync fully. Bootstrapping \u2013 Instead of letting your node communicate to other nodes and build the consensus itself, you download someone else\u2019s consensus file to speed up the download and build process. This is only practical if you actually trust the person that you will be bootstrapping from. A borked consensus file can have security implications. On a computer with a good connection, hardware, and an SSD, it takes 1-2 hours to bootstrap, and with a HDD it takes ~6 hours. This tutorial will be using the bootstrap method to sync because I don\u2019t want to waste too much of my time XD. In order to bootstrap, force close Sia-UI like this: Now download the consensus file from a trusted community website(for the we\u2019ll be using Siastats ). So head to Siastats and scroll to the bottom of the homepage. Then click \u201cConsensus Download\u201d Now, click on the \u201cbootrap.zip\u201d This is quite a large file and can take a long while to download. When zipped, it\u2019s about ~11GB of storage, and once decompressed(how it has to be when in use) it takes up ~22GB currently(this grows over time). This large consensus size is being worked on actively by the Sia Foundation as of now and likely in 2021/2022 there will be an implementation that allows you to run a full node with only a 50KB Utreexo chain state file. Now you have to navigate to the Sia folder so you can replace the consensus.db file with the bootstrap one. So to do that, press win + r to open the run window and type in %appdata%\\Sia-UI\\sia\\consensus . Open the bootstrap zip file and drag it into the consensus folder. Now that that is complete, open Sia-UI. And now we wait. One may ask, \u201cwhat is it doing right now?\u201d Well, despite having the consensus caught up, all of the other modules have not caught up. So it is effectively scanning through all previous blocks to fill out the other databases it uses. On a computer with a beefy CPU and SSD, it takes ~1 hour to sync up, and on a weaker computer with an HDD, it can take around ~6 hours. Now that it has loaded, you have to put your seed back in and click \u201cunlock\u201d To begin renting go to the \u201cRent\u201d tab Then, based on the Siastats pricing(I\u2019d generally recommend taking the storage pricing on Siastats and multiplying it by 1.5), you\u2019re gonna want to set your allowance to that. Click on \u201cSetup Allowance\u201d So go to the \u201cAdvanced\u201d tab for a tad more control. Now that you\u2019re in the tab, you can edit the \u201cAllowance Funds\u201d in accordance to as described earlier, \u201cExpected Storage\u201d in accordance to how much you want to store, \u201cExpected Download\u201d to however much you presume you will download, and \u201cExpected Upload\u201d to roughly the same as expected storage(because you have to upload the data you store of course). Keep in mind that the allowance is kinda fluid so you can always increase it later with no issues. Also, if you don\u2019t put in enough funds, you will run out and not be able to download files anymore once uploaded(to troubleshoot common issues, see here ). Make sure to keep hosts set to 50, the contract period to three months, and the renew period to one month. To learn more about the technical side of how renting functions and why they must be set to this, see here . Now that the allowance has been set, the final waiting game will commence. Only 10 contracts can be formed per block(each block takes 10 minuets to occur on average, too see the latest blocks see Siastats ). So to form the 50 contracts required to rent, it generally will take about an hour. You can begin to upload data at the 30 contract mark, but it will be very slow until it reaches 50 contracts. Now that you have formed 50 contracts, you can begin to upload files by dragging creating a folder by right clicking and hitting \u201cCreate Folder\u201d Then name a folder and click \u201cCreate\u201d Now once in the folder, click on the up arrow and select a file with the file picker: Give that a bit of time to upload Side note, the minimum file size on Sia is 40MB and the redundancy of siac (the underlying code that Sia-UI uses) is 3x, so no matter how small the file is, it takes up 40MB of paid space and 120MB of paid upload bandwidth to send it to three hosts.

The Sia Foundation proposal Proposal: The Sia Foundation from r/siacoin How did this fork affect the Siacoins in circulation? You can see it on this SiaStats chart. The inflation increased in 2021 by roughly 10%, but that's only because of 1.57 GS that the Sia Foundation directly received as you can see here and because of the 30KS per block that are being paid out monthly. This means it will be around 5% in the following years and slowly decrease. Sia Foundation is non-profit, so it must follow laws and as you can see in the tracker above, we can transparently see its fund management. Due to legal reasons and requirements, Sia Foundation also paid 800M SC to the Skynet Labs for the Sia IP ownership (at the time this was decided and approved by community, it was worth of $1,000,000 - for comparison, about 15% of total development cost of Sia). That said, both teams are closely co-operating with the same goals as ever, making Sia the backbone of future internet. Sia Foundation focuses on the core tech and Skynet Labs work on the Skynet, bringing mainstream adoption to Sia. We are putting effort to explain it because it's very common in crypto world that whenever any dev team receives a lot of coins, it's seen as exit scam. Also, splits are usually seen as bad thing. But not for Sia and Skynet, both projects helping each other. And not when it comes to these devs. They are the same peoples who worked for years with different model than anyone else. Where other projects went with ICO, pre-mines, airdrops, trusted setups and no risk since they were paid ahead, Sia developers did this all with zero SC contribution from the community, no ICO or pre-mine. Until now. It's quite ironic that only thanks to birth of Sia Foundation receiving SC from the blockchain, all the previous \"investments\" from people who bought SC can be finally seen as investments into the network and the non-profit entity working developing it. What about Sia\u2019s own unlimited supply? In the end it\u2019s all about supply and demand. Over time, it could happen that majority of circulating supply ends up locked in storage contracts and/or held by people. This could make it very difficult for people using to pay for their storage. That\u2019s why Sia is always going to have a block reward so there is always a way to get SC. You can read more about it in our Introduction to Sia. Since we know the block reward, we can tell how many SC there will be at any point in future. And we can tell that while supply is maybe theoretically infinite, it is truly infinite only if our lifes were infinite. The fact is that in our lifetimes, the supply will double maybe in next 8 years. But for Filecoin, it will double in next few weeks. So what should you do? Zoom out. Also don\u2019t trust, verify \u2013 make your own research. And if you still doubt Sia and Skynet, go and try all of the alternatives. Then go to Siasky.net, upload picture, video or an entire website. And send a link to your friend:) What is the hard fork? Hard fork is event when new version of software is released and it has different \u201crules\u201d . It results in two seperate blockchains, where one is being used by those who do not update and continue using old version. And the new blockchain that is using the new version. In this case, Sia is forking to introduce changes to the block reward. Up to the point in time before its activation, both blockchains have identical history. It is as if someone duplicated it. If you held for example 1000 SC before, you will now have 1000 SC (which are actually 1000 SCC) on legacy blockchain and 1000 SC on the new one. But they are not the same, community usually gives them different tickers to distinguish them, like SC and SCC. Does it mean you will have double the amount of SC? No. You will have twice the coins, but each set of coins is on a seperate network and all new transactions can only be on one chain. Let\u2019s look at one good example from Sia\u2019s own history. The fork in 2018 resulted in two chains: Sia (after update, used by versions 1.3.7 and higher, let\u2019s call it SC after its currency) and the legacy one (used by those who didn\u2019t update, which was called SCC(there were also other forks, but they're not important here)). If you had SC before the fork, when the network split happened, you had same history (seed, blocks, addresses, transactions) on both blockchains, but after that moment, each blockchain went own way. That means you had same amount of different coins that weren\u2019t compatible with each other \u2013 if you made transaction with SCC after the fork or mined coins on SCC chain, they would only exist on SCC blockchain, not on Sia. And vice versa. Since this fork was well accepted by vast majority of the community there is no legacy chain expected to survive . You can still access your legacy coins if you use the old wallet software at any point in future, but there will be no one who continues using it. In other words, it will(in all likelyhood) be worthless. What does it mean for me? Help me! This fork will activate at a block height 298,000 which is expected to be on February 3rd . Update to version 1.5.4 is necessary to spend coins, receive coins, rent, or host after the fork . If you don\u2019t upgrade in time (or at least before next time you run Sia), you will get your consensus.db file stuck to the legacy blockchain. consensus.db is the file that syncs the blockchain to your computer, and if you don\u2019t update now, you will have to eventually re-sync it which is very time consuming operation. If you rent or host on Sia Renters and hosts need to upgrade to 1.5.4 by February 3rd . Doing so ensures that renters will continue to upload data to hosts also on the new fork. Hosts who fail to upgrade in time will no longer form contracts with renters who upgrade. Long story short, you need to be on the same version as everyone else or you aren\u2019t part of the same network. If you hold Siacoins in own wallet (Sia-UI) If you have Siacoins stored in official Sia-UI wallet, all you need to do is to update to 1.5.4 . You control the seed (private key) and you will have instant access to your SC on the new Sia chain. If you hold Siacoins in own wallet (Sia Central) Ledger Nano S users will have to update their apps . Those not using Ledger don\u2019t have to do anything, the site will update the node it connects to so you won\u2019t have to. You control the seed (private key) and you will have instant access to your SC on the new Sia chain. If you hold Siacoins on exchange You don\u2019t have to do anything, the exchange will update the node it connects to so you won\u2019t have to. Also, the exchange controls the seed (private key) so it\u2019s not your issue at all. Your Siacoin balance is the balance you have in their exchange\u2019s internal database and it will be the same after the fork as it was before. It is good idea to never keep your coins on Exchange unless you are trading actively and you know what you are doing. It is rather rare today but many exchanges in the past ended up with users losing their assets. When you have coins on Exchange, they are not really yours since you don\u2019t have the seed (private key). It is very similar to your bank account, the money are not yours. It is the bank that keeps them and allows you access it through its system. If that system goes down, what will you do? You can prevent this scenario by keeping coins in your own wallet out of exchanges. If you mine Siacoin Nothing changes. Only ones who need to update are the mining pools . We already updated our list of Mining Pools, so all that you find there confirmed the update.

Written by: Danger & Covalent, Last Edit: April 14, 2021","title":"If you mine Siacoin"},{"location":"sia/history/index.html","text":"History of Sia Sia initially started as an idea by David Vorick in 2013 that he was discussing over email with Luke Champine, calling it \u201c the Nimbus network \u201d. After writing the first draft of the whitepaper in September (called \u201c Bytecoin \u201d), David shared it with college friends who together with Luke began programming a prototype. The project was then renamed once more to Sia (the Egyptian god of perception, pronounced [sigh-uh]) . It met with positive response on BitcoinTalk, and so David decided to work on Sia full-time as a startup. Together with Luke they applied for Y Combinator, a startup accelerator, and got through the initial screen but were ultimately rejected as the project would take much longer to build than anticipated. They didn\u2019t have to wait for their chance much longer. After one BitcoinTalk user abused David\u2019s hand-drawn diagrams in order to fraudulently raise money, it was clear that there is enough interest to raise money via crowdfunding. Not only was the crowdfunding successful, it also helped them with raising contacts and getting introduced to Jim Pallota and their first traditional investment funding. They formally incorporated Nebulous, Inc. , and soon after sold Sianotes , later convertible to Siafunds ( a supplementary token of the Sia network, see more in Tokenomics guide ). But Sia was a very different project back then. It used Proof of Storage consensus instead of the current Proof of Work ( explained in Introduction to Sia ), hosts were grouped into \u201c quorum \u201d that were responsible for storing users\u2019 files, and the wallet was also fully scriptable. Ultimately, David discovered issues in the Proof of Storage algorithm that forced them to start over, but thanks to David\u2019s participation in the Bitcoin core developer community around that time, he became able to understand the unique challenges of cryptocurrencies and use this knowledge to lay a path towards the efficient and well-designed Sia platform as we know it today. The re-created Sia was heavily inspired by Bitcoin, but improving some of its known deficiencies and using a transaction type that enables storage contracts (digital contracts between those providing storage and paying for storage ). It became formalized in the second whitepaper titled \u201cSia: Simple Decentralized Storage\u201d in November 2014 and the beta version was publicly released six months later with the genesis block being created on June 6th, 2015 at 10:13 EST. The development continued over the years and steady progress was made through the 1.3.x series. Despite many required workarounds, around that time some companies started working on first products using Sia. Today, you can see some of them in our Discover section. In 2018, many other interesting events happened. There was another Siafund offering and also development of ASICs being announced to the Sia network in form of the Obelisk project during summer 2017. This was in order to move on from GPU mining and provide better security to it and had heavy support from entire community. Important part of Sia\u2019s mining history There were some hints late in 2017 but majority of the Sia community was surprised when early in 2018 Bitmain announced its Sia ASIC, Antminer A3 shipping in January. While inferior to the expected Obelisk SC1 miner, Bitmain probably wanted to be the dominant player in ASIC industry and as soon as Sia publicly announced its Obelisk plans, they rushed in using their facilities and knowledge and managed to ship inefficient but working ASIC as first to market. Community discussed the potential fork right away but we didn\u2019t know the truth back then, so these miners were allowed to the network. However, just few months later thanks to research of the community it was clear what happened. Bitmain created many times more units than was healthy and killed everyone\u2019s ROI (Return Of Investment) and by everyone I mean their own customers. Later it was discovered that Bitmain was mining for months on these units before dumping them to the customers. Sadly enough, there was only winner, Bitmain. Few months later, another manufacturer appeared with way stronger Innosilicon S11 miner and even if many miners still think today that Sia bricked their A3 with the following fork, the reality is simple \u2013 Innosilicon\u2019s miners turned A3 into unprofitable devices long time before the fork even happened. In any case, even these miners were allowed to participate until it became clear during the summer that nearly 50% of all block rewards is going into single wallet address that doesn\u2019t even try to hide it. What did it mean? This manuafacturer was not only selling expensive hardware to its customers, it cheated them second time by competing with them by running majority of network\u2019s hashrate themselves. When the community realized what is going on, the decision to fork the network was inevitable. The community wrote a proposal that was well accepted, however different users had different ideas and the final look of fork was in hands of Sia core team. It was them who enabled Obelisk SC1 to be able of algorithm switch and while this change was pretty simple, it was enough to invalidate all other ASICs on the Sia network while still having at least one ASIC running to provide strong security. This fork happened on November 1, 2018 and was clear message from the community to the manufacturers to focus on manufacturing and selling, not competing with own customers. Also to provide sales numbers and be more transparent so miners can make educated decisions. Today (in 2021) there are devices from multiple companies mining on the network. In 2019, Sia released version is 1.4.0 with codename Draco that was an important milestone in the history and probably the biggest release since 2015. Everyone could notice the complete visual redesign of Sia-UI, but even more happened under the hood, making Sia faster, more robust and ready for the features we\u2019ve been waiting so long for. The most important feature was introduced in version 1.4.2 that followed soon after. This feature was seed-based file recovery and allowed renters to take a snapshot of their backups and then recover from these backups on any computer just by using their seed. Luke Champine also introduced us framework, a low level alternative API for Sia. While requiring more work from third party developers, it gives them way more freedom how to use Sia. A question we occasionally see is: why Siacoin is not an Ethereum token? It is because Sia was actually created before Ethereum existed. But even if it did exist, Sia is a very complex project and has specific requirements that only own unique blockchain and cryptocurrency can meet. It\u2019s also a way to avoid dependency on some outside project or influence, or another network that can be bogged down by a thousand other projects. At the beginning of 2020, version 1.4.3 brought us Skynet , first building blocks of decentralized internet letting us to upload and easily share any content \u2013 static web pages and data to start with. While the most of the development through the year was focused at it, Sia also went through a lot of performance and stability improvements including some important bug fixes. 1.4.4 then added support for uploading directories, encrypting skylinks, unpinning and deletion of skynet files and this trend continued in next versions. Next major version was 1.5.0 known as Equinox . SiaMux was added (multiplexer of connections that reduces the latencies of the communications between hosts and renters), also Handshake was integrated (decentralized domains allowing you to access Skynet content by human-readable links instead of hashes) and Ephemeral Accounts (payment channel technology allowing low latency and higher bandwidth for data transfers between hosts and renters). This release was massive increase for scalability of Skynet, allowing Skynet Portals to handle 100x more traffic. It also activated Renter-Host Protocol v3 (RHP3) which allows faster and more efficient data transfers and is a foundation of many features of the Sia network. One of such features is the ability to host dynamic content. In November 2020, Sia 1.5.1 introduced the Skynet Registry , a database layer on hosts that powers SkyDB , a mutable decentralized database that any app can use. In early 2021 1.5.3 with various improvements and fixes to recently added features. 1.5.4 is currently in testing with more fixes on the way as well as new features. This is also leading up to 1.5.5 where the Foundation fork will occur; Sia development will be directed by changes in two directions: Sia Foundation will continue improving Sia core tech in directions most requested by the Sia community as host stability, small file support or reduction of blockchain requirements with Utreexo. Skynet Labs will focus on Skynet and getting more developers and users.

Written by: Danger & Covalent, Last Edit: April 14, 2021","title":"History of Sia"},{"location":"sia/history/index.html#history-of-sia","text":"Sia initially started as an idea by David Vorick in 2013 that he was discussing over email with Luke Champine, calling it \u201c the Nimbus network \u201d. After writing the first draft of the whitepaper in September (called \u201c Bytecoin \u201d), David shared it with college friends who together with Luke began programming a prototype. The project was then renamed once more to Sia (the Egyptian god of perception, pronounced [sigh-uh]) . It met with positive response on BitcoinTalk, and so David decided to work on Sia full-time as a startup. Together with Luke they applied for Y Combinator, a startup accelerator, and got through the initial screen but were ultimately rejected as the project would take much longer to build than anticipated. They didn\u2019t have to wait for their chance much longer. After one BitcoinTalk user abused David\u2019s hand-drawn diagrams in order to fraudulently raise money, it was clear that there is enough interest to raise money via crowdfunding. Not only was the crowdfunding successful, it also helped them with raising contacts and getting introduced to Jim Pallota and their first traditional investment funding. They formally incorporated Nebulous, Inc. , and soon after sold Sianotes , later convertible to Siafunds ( a supplementary token of the Sia network, see more in Tokenomics guide ). But Sia was a very different project back then. It used Proof of Storage consensus instead of the current Proof of Work ( explained in Introduction to Sia ), hosts were grouped into \u201c quorum \u201d that were responsible for storing users\u2019 files, and the wallet was also fully scriptable. Ultimately, David discovered issues in the Proof of Storage algorithm that forced them to start over, but thanks to David\u2019s participation in the Bitcoin core developer community around that time, he became able to understand the unique challenges of cryptocurrencies and use this knowledge to lay a path towards the efficient and well-designed Sia platform as we know it today. The re-created Sia was heavily inspired by Bitcoin, but improving some of its known deficiencies and using a transaction type that enables storage contracts (digital contracts between those providing storage and paying for storage ). It became formalized in the second whitepaper titled \u201cSia: Simple Decentralized Storage\u201d in November 2014 and the beta version was publicly released six months later with the genesis block being created on June 6th, 2015 at 10:13 EST. The development continued over the years and steady progress was made through the 1.3.x series. Despite many required workarounds, around that time some companies started working on first products using Sia. Today, you can see some of them in our Discover section. In 2018, many other interesting events happened. There was another Siafund offering and also development of ASICs being announced to the Sia network in form of the Obelisk project during summer 2017. This was in order to move on from GPU mining and provide better security to it and had heavy support from entire community. Important part of Sia\u2019s mining history There were some hints late in 2017 but majority of the Sia community was surprised when early in 2018 Bitmain announced its Sia ASIC, Antminer A3 shipping in January. While inferior to the expected Obelisk SC1 miner, Bitmain probably wanted to be the dominant player in ASIC industry and as soon as Sia publicly announced its Obelisk plans, they rushed in using their facilities and knowledge and managed to ship inefficient but working ASIC as first to market. Community discussed the potential fork right away but we didn\u2019t know the truth back then, so these miners were allowed to the network. However, just few months later thanks to research of the community it was clear what happened. Bitmain created many times more units than was healthy and killed everyone\u2019s ROI (Return Of Investment) and by everyone I mean their own customers. Later it was discovered that Bitmain was mining for months on these units before dumping them to the customers. Sadly enough, there was only winner, Bitmain. Few months later, another manufacturer appeared with way stronger Innosilicon S11 miner and even if many miners still think today that Sia bricked their A3 with the following fork, the reality is simple \u2013 Innosilicon\u2019s miners turned A3 into unprofitable devices long time before the fork even happened. In any case, even these miners were allowed to participate until it became clear during the summer that nearly 50% of all block rewards is going into single wallet address that doesn\u2019t even try to hide it. What did it mean? This manuafacturer was not only selling expensive hardware to its customers, it cheated them second time by competing with them by running majority of network\u2019s hashrate themselves. When the community realized what is going on, the decision to fork the network was inevitable. The community wrote a proposal that was well accepted, however different users had different ideas and the final look of fork was in hands of Sia core team. It was them who enabled Obelisk SC1 to be able of algorithm switch and while this change was pretty simple, it was enough to invalidate all other ASICs on the Sia network while still having at least one ASIC running to provide strong security. This fork happened on November 1, 2018 and was clear message from the community to the manufacturers to focus on manufacturing and selling, not competing with own customers. Also to provide sales numbers and be more transparent so miners can make educated decisions. Today (in 2021) there are devices from multiple companies mining on the network. In 2019, Sia released version is 1.4.0 with codename Draco that was an important milestone in the history and probably the biggest release since 2015. Everyone could notice the complete visual redesign of Sia-UI, but even more happened under the hood, making Sia faster, more robust and ready for the features we\u2019ve been waiting so long for. The most important feature was introduced in version 1.4.2 that followed soon after. This feature was seed-based file recovery and allowed renters to take a snapshot of their backups and then recover from these backups on any computer just by using their seed. Luke Champine also introduced us framework, a low level alternative API for Sia. While requiring more work from third party developers, it gives them way more freedom how to use Sia. A question we occasionally see is: why Siacoin is not an Ethereum token? It is because Sia was actually created before Ethereum existed. But even if it did exist, Sia is a very complex project and has specific requirements that only own unique blockchain and cryptocurrency can meet. It\u2019s also a way to avoid dependency on some outside project or influence, or another network that can be bogged down by a thousand other projects. At the beginning of 2020, version 1.4.3 brought us Skynet , first building blocks of decentralized internet letting us to upload and easily share any content \u2013 static web pages and data to start with. While the most of the development through the year was focused at it, Sia also went through a lot of performance and stability improvements including some important bug fixes. 1.4.4 then added support for uploading directories, encrypting skylinks, unpinning and deletion of skynet files and this trend continued in next versions. Next major version was 1.5.0 known as Equinox . SiaMux was added (multiplexer of connections that reduces the latencies of the communications between hosts and renters), also Handshake was integrated (decentralized domains allowing you to access Skynet content by human-readable links instead of hashes) and Ephemeral Accounts (payment channel technology allowing low latency and higher bandwidth for data transfers between hosts and renters). This release was massive increase for scalability of Skynet, allowing Skynet Portals to handle 100x more traffic. It also activated Renter-Host Protocol v3 (RHP3) which allows faster and more efficient data transfers and is a foundation of many features of the Sia network. One of such features is the ability to host dynamic content. In November 2020, Sia 1.5.1 introduced the Skynet Registry , a database layer on hosts that powers SkyDB , a mutable decentralized database that any app can use. In early 2021 1.5.3 with various improvements and fixes to recently added features. 1.5.4 is currently in testing with more fixes on the way as well as new features. This is also leading up to 1.5.5 where the Foundation fork will occur; Sia development will be directed by changes in two directions: Sia Foundation will continue improving Sia core tech in directions most requested by the Sia community as host stability, small file support or reduction of blockchain requirements with Utreexo. Skynet Labs will focus on Skynet and getting more developers and users. Currently 1.5.6 is looming in the horizon with the promise of bringing recursive monitization to Skynet as well as splitting the Foundation siad codebase away from the Skynet skyd codebase.

You maybe heard about it being decentralized cloud storage and started watching it. You maybe traded or mined Siacoin, or maybe heard about some forks and controversies. And maybe you just discovered it. Whatever brough you here, you are looking for resources to understand what Sia really is and how it works. You want to know how this technology empowers users and how it turned a decentralized internet into reality through Skynet. This entire site is dedicated to guiding you through this exciting journey. Decentralized cloud storage platform Sia is a decentralized cloud storage platform . Decentralized means it has no central server or authority that could control the network on its own. Every single node (computer running the Sia software, for example your Sia-UI wallet) is equal and has its own verified copy of the Sia blockchain . Imagine a blockchain like this: you have some set of information (transactions) being sent around, and every 10 minutes that info gets grouped together into something called a block. Then another 10 minutes pass, a new block is made, and is automatically connected (chained) to the one before it. This forms a chain of blocks that is chronologically sorted and cryptographically secured in a way that makes it immutable (cannot be changed) . As I explained earlier, blockchain is a transaction history . That means every single transaction ever made is final, you cannot change or refund it and so you need to be always careful. A good practice is to double or triple check wallet addresses after copy/pasting and check the first and last few characters just to be sure it wasn\u2019t tampered by potentially present malware. Cloud storage platform means that Sia is a platform allowing you to rent and pay for storage space elsewhere in the world for the purpose of having your own private, secure and ever-accessible backups. The platform is using a consensus mechanism (way of reaching an agreement on a state of the blockchain) based on Proof of Work (PoW) . This protocol was first introduced by Bitcoin in 2009 and brought us a process known as mining. Proof of Work means that miners need to spend significant resources on electricity and specialized (often single-purpose) hardware equipment in order to participate in search for a solution to a mathematical problem. This search involves a lot of \u201cluck\u201d as miners compete with each other who finds the answer first. Once they do, it is used to sign the new block which is then broadcasted to the network. If the network accepts it, the finder receives a block reward in form of Siacoin (SC) , the cryptocurrency used on the Sia network. This is how new coins are introduced to the network and further distributed by the miners, usually through the numerous exchanges. As many miners don\u2019t want to depend heavily on luck, they are often working together by being connected to a pool . When a solution is found by a member of the pool, the reward is fairly shared between all who participated in finding that answer based on amount of work done by each of them. What this means is that miners are providing service to the network. They are important for it but can be replaced if their intentions become malicious and threaten the network. But this combined with the block reward is a very good incentive for them to act in best interest of the network. To be honest and provide security because they are rewarded for doing so. Doing otherwise would be way more expensive than any potential gain from doing so. Check our Mining Guide if you want to learn more. If you are interested what would happen if vast majority of miners demanded some changes, make sure to check out the story of Bitcoin\u2019s failed \u201cSegWit2x\u201d fork. Long story short, it was a very important demonstration that the nodes are making and enforcing the rules, not the miners even if backed by some of the biggest companies of the crypto world. What are the advantages of using Sia? Sia lets you backup any data in a way that only allows you to get to it . No government, no authority, not even the hosts who keep encrypted fragments of your data can access it and know what the data is or who it belongs to. They simply can\u2019t. If you are not familiar with encryption , it is a method that uses a digital key (you can imagine it as a password) to change (encode) any data into something unreadable and only way to read (decode) it is to have the key and know the method used. Since 2020, Sia software allows uploading to Skynet , which is a publishing layer utilizing Sia as a storage layer. It allows users to host apps and share content without need for any server or other infrastructure while focusing on censorship resistance . This means that if you want to make your data public and let others pin them, you can do so and in such case a host can tell what data you share (since you made it public). Check our Introduction to Skynet to learn more. This feature is already interesting enough, but there is another factor other than security or privacy. Sia has open marketplace where anyone can become a host or renter and set their own conditions and pricing. This ensures that even if demand for Siacoin increases and the price surges, natural competition will normalize the prices so at any given time, you will pay more or less the price that represents the same or similar value in fiat currencies (USD, EUR, etc.). You don\u2019t even need any permissions. Sia is open-source and permission-less . Anyone can start a node and start hosting, renting, and building products and services on top of Sia network. You can find many guides in other sections of this site. The fact that anyone can become a host and offer his or her unused space to others means that there will not only be data centers with higher pricing for better service quality, but also individual users who will provide other quality service (for example with slower access speed), but for cheap. Since October 2020, hosts also support SkyDB, which is mutable decentralized database that any application can use. You might now be asking, what guarantees that you won\u2019t lose your data if such a host disappears? Well, hosts are incentivized to protect your data by providing collateral that is locked for a duration of your file contracts. If they lose your data, they will lose the collateral that is roughly three times higher than the expected reward. Also, by default Sia is using 3x redundancy which means that when your file is split into 30 fragments, you need only any 10 of them to retrieve the file . These fragments are stored at different hosts so if a host is down, the redundancy indicator temporarily decreases and fragments are automatically replicated at other hosts to ensure the 3x redundancy. In practice it means you are paying for three times the size of your files, but it is still way cheaper and more secure than any other solution (most importantly, you need to remember that main feature is the decentralization). You can also set your own conditions \u2013 \u200afor example to have (even more secure) 16 out of 40 fragments with 2.5x redundancy, but the default setting is already pretty decent. Over time, as the network gets bigger and quality of hosts increases, it is expected that Sia will move towards 1.5x redundancy, which is sufficient and will make it even more affordable. Did you ever wonder why there is minimum block reward set to 30,000 SC per block and are you worried about inflation caused by endless supply? It is so by design as the majority of coins in the future is expected to be locked in contracts. Minimum block reward will guarantee that there is always enough new coins entering circulation so the network can continue working properly and users will be able to acquire coins to pay for storage. Why is Sia important for me? It\u2019s important because you care about your data and privacy . You don\u2019t want to lose your family photos or important data due to the end of some service (remember Megaupload?) or get it compromised by leaks, or even inaccessible at times when you need it most during some blackouts. You don\u2019t want to get de-platformed. With Sia this won\u2019t happen and if 3x redundancy is not letting you sleep at night because of your super important data, set it higher and even whitelist specific hosts in specific regions (so you can always access your data even if entire countries turn dark) . Even then it\u2019s way cheaper than traditional solutions , but more secure than any and all of them. Important : There is issue with backup snapshots in version 1.5.3. It is planned to be fixed in 1.5.4. If you are not sure, feel free to ask on Sia Discord server. You might also have unused space on your home server running nonstop. Now you can start hosting and reduce your running costs or even profit from it. If it sounds interesting for you, we recommend to start small and get familiar with it. You can always plug in additional storage capacity when you\u2019re getting near your limit. Check out our Hosting Guide to learn more. Maybe you are a developer with some ideas or just an enthusiast who wants to learn. Sia is opening a world of new possibilities and kinds of apps that were impossible until today, especially with the Skynet letting developers create applications without need for hosting by using simple API. You can find more details in our guides: Get Started , Build with Sia and Build with Skynet . It\u2019s clear that developers are going to be the first who spot the opportunity and create products that will attract customers. You can check some of these products already built by the community in Examples . This is very exciting since users today can enjoy products built on top of decentralized network without even knowing how it works, or requiring cryptocurrencies. Services can manage storage contracts in crypto for users who pay them with fiat. This opens adoption possibilities that the crypto world has been waiting for. Who is behind Sia and how can I know it will always work? Until 2020, Sia was developed by Nebulous, Inc. , a VC funded company that made this all a reality with less than $10 million raised since 2014. Sia was always technically superior and leader in the space while remaining in shadow of less advanced projects that used an opportunity and raised enormous amounts of money during the ICO times. Sia never had an ICO or pre-mine. It is not even trusted setup. All coins were mined by anyone who was interested in doing so. In 2020, the core team was holding less than 0.1% of all SC. The developers are motivated by possession of network\u2019s supplementary token, Siafund (more about it in Tokenomics ) which pays out part of successful storage contract fees on Sia network to its holders. Where majority of other projects raised a lot of money at beginning, focus on hype and buzz words and have no real incentive to ever introduce a working product while they fake it until they make it, Sia is complete opposite of it. In order for Siafunds to create meaningful source of income, the network has to grow immensely. Common concern was that price has stagnated and project must be dead, but price says nothing about the actual progress that was made. Also there are no shortcuts for such tech and for first few years it wasn\u2019t simply production ready. Sia could go the same way as others and focus on price and marketing, but there would be no working product as a result. For working product, user experience is important and until 2019 it wasn\u2019t possible. Bringing it to masses could cause irreversible damaged becase they tech wasn\u2019t ready. Today it is. There are still things to fix and improve but it is fairly stable and with great things on the horizon. You can be sure Sia will work because it doesn\u2019t depend on the devs . The network is permission-less and open-source, anyone can run it. If the dev team disappeared, it would continue running and very likely someone would take over its development. At least this was the case until now. Starting early in 2021, Sia development moves under the newly established non profit organization named Sia Foundation . Covalent here: I do want to comment that \"doesn't depend on the devs\" is a tad misleading. Sure, if the devs up and left, the network itself wouldn't blow up. But like every other ecosystem of software, the system needs dedicated developers for both the front and back end or it will fizzle out. Sia Foundation is be funded (fork happened in February 2021) by addition of 30,000 SC (that is thirty thousand for those europeans out there) to block reward (you can find more details in the Proposal that was very warmly accepted by the community). While the inflation increased slightly (especially compared to majority of other projects), it allows Sia Foundation to focus on parts of the Sia core tech that were previously difficult to justify for a VC funded company. People often forget that this all was done by a team with very small funding and they have never seen anything for it. And still won\u2019t. Sia Foundation is non-profit organization and needs to report spendings in transparent way. It is led by Sia co-founder Luke Champine who is expected to be joined by more representatives over time. Foundation will use the funds to help the Sia core tech to be more stable, efficient and user friendly. Most requested features are host stability fixes and improvements, small file support and Utreexo which is feature dramatically reducing blockchain requirements so lite nodes become a reality. That will open entire new world of possibilities on all kinds of devices. Foundation also plans to provide legal support to nodes participating on Sia network and burn any coins that it is unable to use for overall good and growth of the ecosystem . Official place to come and communicate with Sia Foundation is its forum . Skynet Labs is re-branded Nebulous, Inc. , the company that created Sia with its founder and CEO, David Vorick . Since it is just re-branding of company, the entire team is the same with exception of Luke who continues to focus on Sia core. For majority of 2020, Skynet Labs were already focusing on task that community was asking several years for. Getting Sia adoption grow. Skynet is biggest product built with Sia and it is directly integrated in it. Where Sia is trying to compete in decentralized cloud storage space, Skynet competes with entire centralized internet and offers an alternative. How this fight will look, that remains to be seen but it\u2019s clear it opens attractive space for developers, content creators and their followers . It introduces users to completely new way of using internet. In a way where they control own data and decide which (client-side) application can access them. There were also several more recent hires by end of 2020 with one interesting fact \u2013 number of marketing employees went from 0 straight to 4 just in last two months of 2020 and according to the stats of devs, Skynet is picking up rapidly, growing by about 40% every month. But what does this all mean? It means that this split is good for anyone interested in Sia. It doesn\u2019t mean the project is abandoned and devs are leaving it. For first time in Sia\u2019s history, it is going to maintain presence on two battlefields. Sia Foundation will do everything in best interest of Sia, its technology, ecosystem and participants. And Skynet will be main force driving the adoption. Since Skynet uses Sia, it uses Siacoin (SC). It creates awareness and demand for the token to be used. By users who want to store data, by hosts as collateral and reward and by Skynet Portals who pay for activity of their users. This all is kind of usage that is on top of the only kind of usage that majority of projects has \u2013 the always present speculation. Also the bigger the network and amount of stored and accessed data, the more it will be rewarding for the Siafund holders. It\u2019s win for everyone involved. The incentives feel to be just right and entire collective behind this site awaits the future with excitement and passion. Where to continue from here? Try Introduction to Skynet.

Maybe you are a developer with some ideas or just an enthusiast who wants to learn. Sia is opening a world of new possibilities and kinds of apps that were impossible until today, especially with the Skynet letting developers create applications without need for hosting by using simple API. You can find more details in our guides: Get Started , Build with Sia and Build with Skynet . It\u2019s clear that developers are going to be the first who spot the opportunity and create products that will attract customers. You can check some of these products already built by the community in Examples . This is very exciting since users today can enjoy products built on top of decentralized network without even knowing how it works, or requiring cryptocurrencies. Services can manage storage contracts in crypto for users who pay them with fiat. This opens adoption possibilities that the crypto world has been waiting for.","title":"Why is Sia important for me?"},{"location":"sia/introduction/index.html#who-is-behind-sia-and-how-can-i-know-it-will-always-work","text":"Until 2020, Sia was developed by Nebulous, Inc. , a VC funded company that made this all a reality with less than $10 million raised since 2014. Sia was always technically superior and leader in the space while remaining in shadow of less advanced projects that used an opportunity and raised enormous amounts of money during the ICO times. Sia never had an ICO or pre-mine. It is not even trusted setup. All coins were mined by anyone who was interested in doing so. In 2020, the core team was holding less than 0.1% of all SC. The developers are motivated by possession of network\u2019s supplementary token, Siafund (more about it in Tokenomics ) which pays out part of successful storage contract fees on Sia network to its holders. Where majority of other projects raised a lot of money at beginning, focus on hype and buzz words and have no real incentive to ever introduce a working product while they fake it until they make it, Sia is complete opposite of it. In order for Siafunds to create meaningful source of income, the network has to grow immensely. Common concern was that price has stagnated and project must be dead, but price says nothing about the actual progress that was made. Also there are no shortcuts for such tech and for first few years it wasn\u2019t simply production ready. Sia could go the same way as others and focus on price and marketing, but there would be no working product as a result. For working product, user experience is important and until 2019 it wasn\u2019t possible. Bringing it to masses could cause irreversible damaged becase they tech wasn\u2019t ready. Today it is. There are still things to fix and improve but it is fairly stable and with great things on the horizon. You can be sure Sia will work because it doesn\u2019t depend on the devs . The network is permission-less and open-source, anyone can run it. If the dev team disappeared, it would continue running and very likely someone would take over its development. At least this was the case until now. Starting early in 2021, Sia development moves under the newly established non profit organization named Sia Foundation . Covalent here: I do want to comment that \"doesn't depend on the devs\" is a tad misleading. Sure, if the devs up and left, the network itself wouldn't blow up. But like every other ecosystem of software, the system needs dedicated developers for both the front and back end or it will fizzle out. Sia Foundation is be funded (fork happened in February 2021) by addition of 30,000 SC (that is thirty thousand for those europeans out there) to block reward (you can find more details in the Proposal that was very warmly accepted by the community). While the inflation increased slightly (especially compared to majority of other projects), it allows Sia Foundation to focus on parts of the Sia core tech that were previously difficult to justify for a VC funded company. People often forget that this all was done by a team with very small funding and they have never seen anything for it. And still won\u2019t. Sia Foundation is non-profit organization and needs to report spendings in transparent way. It is led by Sia co-founder Luke Champine who is expected to be joined by more representatives over time. Foundation will use the funds to help the Sia core tech to be more stable, efficient and user friendly. Most requested features are host stability fixes and improvements, small file support and Utreexo which is feature dramatically reducing blockchain requirements so lite nodes become a reality. That will open entire new world of possibilities on all kinds of devices. Foundation also plans to provide legal support to nodes participating on Sia network and burn any coins that it is unable to use for overall good and growth of the ecosystem . Official place to come and communicate with Sia Foundation is its forum . Skynet Labs is re-branded Nebulous, Inc. , the company that created Sia with its founder and CEO, David Vorick . Since it is just re-branding of company, the entire team is the same with exception of Luke who continues to focus on Sia core. For majority of 2020, Skynet Labs were already focusing on task that community was asking several years for. Getting Sia adoption grow. Skynet is biggest product built with Sia and it is directly integrated in it. Where Sia is trying to compete in decentralized cloud storage space, Skynet competes with entire centralized internet and offers an alternative. How this fight will look, that remains to be seen but it\u2019s clear it opens attractive space for developers, content creators and their followers . It introduces users to completely new way of using internet. In a way where they control own data and decide which (client-side) application can access them. There were also several more recent hires by end of 2020 with one interesting fact \u2013 number of marketing employees went from 0 straight to 4 just in last two months of 2020 and according to the stats of devs, Skynet is picking up rapidly, growing by about 40% every month. But what does this all mean? It means that this split is good for anyone interested in Sia. It doesn\u2019t mean the project is abandoned and devs are leaving it. For first time in Sia\u2019s history, it is going to maintain presence on two battlefields. Sia Foundation will do everything in best interest of Sia, its technology, ecosystem and participants. And Skynet will be main force driving the adoption. Since Skynet uses Sia, it uses Siacoin (SC). It creates awareness and demand for the token to be used. By users who want to store data, by hosts as collateral and reward and by Skynet Portals who pay for activity of their users. This all is kind of usage that is on top of the only kind of usage that majority of projects has \u2013 the always present speculation. Also the bigger the network and amount of stored and accessed data, the more it will be rewarding for the Siafund holders. It\u2019s win for everyone involved. The incentives feel to be just right and entire collective behind this site awaits the future with excitement and passion. Where to continue from here? Try Introduction to Skynet.

Miners are using expensive hardware (ASIC \u2013 Application-Specific Integrated Circuit) in order to race to find a special sequence of characters (called hash) purely by luck. Of course, you can get the luck on your side or join forces with others and split the reward each time your group (called Mining Pool) is successful. Let\u2019s look at it in more detail. What is blockchain? Blockchain is nothing special, it is just kind of database where data are contained in structures called blocks and they are added on top of each other in a way that makes it impossible to change any block without changing all of the following blocks. What is making blockchain unique and amazing technology is decentralization. Blockchains like Bitcoin or Sia are decentralized which means that if you want to change anything, you need to get all computers participating in the network to agree with the change, which is practically impossible. That\u2019s why it is called immutable. When it comes to new blocks, they need to be validated by the network as well. Each node validates it separately and if it finds ok, it adds it to own copy of blockchain. How are blocks created? Whenever a transaction happens on the network, it is added to a transaction pool. That\u2019s a special place a miner looks into and adds the transactions to a block. And at the same time he constantly attempts to find a matching hash \u2013 one that will work as signature for block\u2019s content. This involves a lot of luck and is a reason why it sometimes takes a minute to find a block and sometimes 30 minutes or rarely more. This process is called Proof of Work (PoW) and is one of the best consensus mechanics since it guarantees that in order to find the blocks, a lot of computation (hashrate) needs to be happen. Let\u2019s introduce a constant now, block time = 10 minutes. You might think \u201cBut the blocks are never found every 10 minutes!\u201d and you are right. This time is used to keep track of mining schedule. If a lot of hashrate connects to the network suddenly (it is common each time new ASIC is manufacturer), miners will start finding blocks in very fast succession. But if you are worried this means that with more hashrate you can make too many coins quickly, you are wrong. This is where difficulty and the schedule comes into play. Difficulty is special kind of value that increases when blocks are found ahead of the schedule and decreases when it\u2019s behind. This change happens every single block (unlike for Bitcoin where it happens in specific intervals) and means that if a lot of blocks was found quickly (for example 1-3 minutes), next blocks will take much longer (can be 20-60 minutes). And that\u2019s all thanks to the difficulty value that directly affects the chance that valid hash is found in relation to the available hashrate. And the most important part is\u2026 only the one miner that found the hash, signed the block and broadcasted the block to network gets the block reward. After that, process repeats with new block. Over and over. What are you telling me? That I need to find the block myself? No, Neo. I\u2019m trying to tell you that when you\u2019re ready, you won\u2019t have to. That\u2019s one option. Some miners run their ASICs as kind of lottery. If you know that network hashrate (can find in Network Metrics ) is 8,600 TH/s and you have one miner with 2.2 THS hashrate, it means you are 1 / 3909 of the total hashrate. In other words, you should find roughly 1 block per 3909 blocks, which can be translated to 27 days. Of course, due to the luck factor, you can find 3 blocks in a week or no block in 3 months. But usually over longer period of time this gets quite accurate. Especially if you run more miners than one. And that gets us to the Mining Pools . These are special sites where you get the address of the server and then use it in configuration of your miner. Each computation (share) of your miner is sent to the pool and this allows many miners to co-operate. It is very fair since the mining pool knows exactly how many shares who sent (miners with higher hashrate will contribute more) and the rewards are then distributed fairly according to the number of shares submitted by you in relation to the total number of shares submitted by everyone using the same pool. Now that we covered the principles, let\u2019s look at what should you do. Should I start mining? This really depends on what is your goal . If you want to help the ecosystem to be more secure and hashrate better distributed , just go on. You should make sure you don\u2019t do it at a loss since your electricity is likely more expensive at home than for those who run it in colocation centers. And if you do, then at least try to find secondary use to it. Since ASICs generate a lot of heat, many miners use single or multiple units for heating of their homes and garages. In that case always take safety measures and don\u2019t hesitate to ask others for help. Also you should know that ASICs are making A LOT of noise. If you want to do it for profit , you need to do a lot of research, preparation and calculation. There is cost to everything \u2013 Hardware, Hosting / Location, Electricity. Since miners can relocate (they are heavy but can be moved) quite easily, you need to select right location and that will allow you to get cheap electricity and renting cost. You can also go for renewable sources of energy. Those have higher initial cost but allow you to run the miners for their entire lifetime (until they break). Popular choices are hydropower or solar power plants. There is one special term that every miner knows well \u2013 Return of Investment (ROI) . You should always keep in ming in how much time you can recover your initial investment. Also keep in mind it\u2019s all very risky. Some manufacturing companies in the past didn\u2019t hesitate to kill the ROI of own customers by over-producing units so much that only the manufacturer ever did any profit. There were also many miners that were promised and accepted pre-orders but never delivered. You should always verify that what you pay for is a real thing and that manufacturer doesn\u2019t play against you. If you decided that you want to start mining, best you can do is probably to join Sia Foundation discord and ask in #mining channel for up to date hardware recommendations. You can also learn from others how to buy and setup a miner and what to be careful about.

Written by: Danger & Covalent, Last Edit: April 14, 2021","title":"Should I start mining?"},{"location":"sia/renting/index.html","text":"Renting As gone over in the introduction to Sia article, Sia is decentralized storage platform . It is composed mainly of three parties, renters, miners, and hosts. In this article, I will be going over the renter module; so I will be going over what it is, how it works, and how you can set one up today. What is renting? In essence, a Sia renter nodes only do a couple of things. They pay hosts to store data for them as well as paying the host to download that data once uploaded. They do that in tandem with fancy math and a dedicated cryptocurrency to make sure the data is safe and highly available. Now, of course, in practice it\u2019s a tad more complicated than that. But that\u2019s all you really have to know in order to use it. So if you don\u2019t particularly care about the technical side to it but want to store data on the Sia network, just skip to the Setting up a renter section. How does it work? Before reading this it is probably best if you read the Introduction to Sia article written by Danger so I don\u2019t have to re-explain everything. Okay, now that you have read that, how does a renter node actually work assuming there is an established network of hosts and miners already doing their jobs? Well the main components/aspects that make a functional renter are following in no particular order: Host selection algorithm Redundancy Storage contracts Erasure coding Encryption Host selection algorithm The host selection algorithm in siad is relatively simple. It effectively polls all hosts that are accepting new renters, checks their prices and response time, then chooses hosts based on those parameters and arbitrary weights the devs put on certain aspects of the hosts. For example, the devs may think that performance is more important than download price, so even if a host has a very cheap download price, siad may choose a host with lower latency to give a better experience to the user. Note, siad is the main module that pretty much everything Sia based is built upon. It contains the basic renter, host, miner, wallet, etc functionality necessary to use the Sia network. There are minimal clients available like Luke Champine\u2019s us , but none are actually usable to an average user, they require custom built tooling to actually function unlike siad . Also the name is derived from Sia + daemon, so siad . Due to the decentralized nature of Sia, fresh renter nodes have no idea what hosts are reliable, fast, or really any metric that isn\u2019t being advertised by the hosts(so basically anything but price). So often when new nodes are created, the renter has to \u201cchurn\u201d a bunch of bad hosts before it can reach a set of hosts that is reliable enough to use. This can make storing < 1TB of data seem inexplicably high in comparison to what is advertised on the Sia website or Hakkane\u2019s Siastats . Redundancy This is kind of a basic component to the renter node, but the whole idea of Sia hinges on this to be price competitive; hosts don\u2019t have to be reliable. Generally, for high availability, the amount of nine\u2019s of uptime counted is the most important factor, so 99.9999% uptime would be good, but not incredible. The whole idea is flipped on it\u2019s head with Sia, if a host is above 95%(that\u2019s a week or so of downtime a year) uptime, it\u2019s probably fine. One may say that this would make renting prohibitively expensive because you have to pay for the data multiple times, but this is contradicted by the fact that if you don\u2019t have to have incredible uptime hardware costs are lower. You can cut costs by just not paying for a lot of the \u201ctraditional server\u201d setup. To have a storage server traditionally, you\u2019d have to pay for stable power, buy UPSes, purchase good dedicated internet, pay for the facilities , etc. But with Sia you can have a bunch of 8GB raspberry pis, with a couple of 12TB hard drives connected to each one in your basement and that\u2019s it. Costs can be greatly reduced through cheap hosts, throughput can greatly increase due to parallelism, and reliability can greatly increase just by paying multiple hosts to store the data. By default, the Sia renter uploads each file 3 times, so 3x redundancy. Though it is a tad more complex than that because it also uses erasure coding to increase reliability. Also Skynet uses 10x redundancy because 3x wasn\u2019t fast enough when it was initially created. Learn more in Introduction to Skynet . Though this is actually changing. Basically, the base sector(used to find the file on the hosts) is going to stay at 10x redundancy, but for anthing over that it will be stored in a 3x(10 of 30) redundancy scheme to lower costs. For something like video streaming, the origional 4MB sector should store a couple seconds worth of video(5 seconds at 8mbps) which should give siad plenty of time to find the location of the rest of the sectors. Storage contracts Storage contracts are the magic that make Sia a truly permissionless storage network. On a high level, a storage contract is a payment channel between the renter and host with some metadata on top of it; for more info on payment channels listen to this talk . For those that don\u2019t feel like watching that, but want the gist of payment channels, effectively one party puts in a certain amount of crypto into a \u201csmart contract.\u201d This money is unavailable until the arbitrary end date of this contract when it will be resolved. Whenever the sender(in this case the renter node), wants to send money, instead of sending a transaction over the network and having to wait an hour for multiple confirmations, the sender just adds some coin to the \u201csent\u201d section of the payment contract, then signs it. The other party(in this case the host) sees this signed contract, and knows that it can safely broadcast this later to get the money inside the channel. The sender cannot revoke this money sent because it has already signed it, and it cannot be iterated downwards, because the receiver could always just broadcast the transaction with more money to make more money. So this is safe way to send money with latency in milliseconds instead of hours. Anyhow, storage contracts have one other thing built in that makes them special in comparison to plain payment channels. This is the storage proof. What this means is that the host doesn\u2019t only have to have the signature of the renter in order to take the money from the channel, but they have to prove that they still have the data from the renter by submitting a Merkle tree root that combines a hash of the data and some entropy to make sure that they cannot prove it in advance. I\u2019m gonna stop here because it can get incredibly complex and nuanced, and you can learn more about it here . But, basically, just know that the storage contract is the thing that allows the Sia network to function without trust. One more thing to note. It is often brought up how the minimum sector size with Sia is 4 MiB. And the reason the team originally made this decision is actually because of the limitations of the storage contract. You can read more about it from Luke here . The basic idea was that Sia was originally based on 64B \u201csegments\u201d, but since storing one Merkle root is 32B, this made it so if you were storing 2TB of data, you\u2019d have to store 1TB of metadata. They quickly saw this for what it was, a big issue. So in order to solve this problem, they tried to take a middle ground in \u201csector\u201d size and take the root of that instead of the \u201csegment.\u201d They chose 4MiB as a nice middle ground between metadata size and performance arbitrarily. So if you now upload any file, it\u2019ll be padded to 4MiB no matter the size in order to fit inside that sector. This is being actively worked on to be reduced. Erasure coding Erasure coding is the second trick Sia uses to increase the availability of data. For a technical explanation, read this . If you didn\u2019t read that the basic idea is this, fragmentation of data provides a far greater amount of reliability than redundancy does. So in order to take advantage of that, a normal Sia renter node uses a 10 of 30 scheme. So basically, instead of just uploading each sector to a different node 3 times, it does fancy math to zip-tie 10 sectors together make it so any 10 of the 30 uploaded sectors can retrieve the data of what was originally put in. Unfortunately, this does come at the cost of increasing the minimum file size to 40MB, but the devs thought it okay to do that because it made the renter node much more reliable. Side note, Skynet does not use erasure coding because it wasn\u2019t fast enough on release, learn more in Introduction to Skynet . Again, as stated earlier, this is somewhat changing. Encryption Encryption is effectively just fancy math that allows you to take data and a \u201cpassword\u201d(also knows as a private key), then turn that into another piece of data that can only be viewed if you have the corresponding private key. To get a better explanation with nice visuals, check out this 3blue1brown video . Technical details aside, the use of encryption makes it so you can safely send sensitive data to hosts without worry of them being able to view it. You never send the private key of your data to the host, so to them it\u2019s just random jibber-jabber that they get paid to store. Security wise, it\u2019s the same as just using a hard-drive you own. Setting up a renter To set up a renter, follow the steps in Renting on Sia .

There are minimal clients available like Luke Champine\u2019s us , but none are actually usable to an average user, they require custom built tooling to actually function unlike siad . Also the name is derived from Sia + daemon, so siad . Due to the decentralized nature of Sia, fresh renter nodes have no idea what hosts are reliable, fast, or really any metric that isn\u2019t being advertised by the hosts(so basically anything but price). So often when new nodes are created, the renter has to \u201cchurn\u201d a bunch of bad hosts before it can reach a set of hosts that is reliable enough to use. This can make storing < 1TB of data seem inexplicably high in comparison to what is advertised on the Sia website or Hakkane\u2019s Siastats .","title":"Host selection algorithm"},{"location":"sia/renting/index.html#redundancy","text":"This is kind of a basic component to the renter node, but the whole idea of Sia hinges on this to be price competitive; hosts don\u2019t have to be reliable. Generally, for high availability, the amount of nine\u2019s of uptime counted is the most important factor, so 99.9999% uptime would be good, but not incredible. The whole idea is flipped on it\u2019s head with Sia, if a host is above 95%(that\u2019s a week or so of downtime a year) uptime, it\u2019s probably fine. One may say that this would make renting prohibitively expensive because you have to pay for the data multiple times, but this is contradicted by the fact that if you don\u2019t have to have incredible uptime hardware costs are lower. You can cut costs by just not paying for a lot of the \u201ctraditional server\u201d setup. To have a storage server traditionally, you\u2019d have to pay for stable power, buy UPSes, purchase good dedicated internet, pay for the facilities , etc. But with Sia you can have a bunch of 8GB raspberry pis, with a couple of 12TB hard drives connected to each one in your basement and that\u2019s it. Costs can be greatly reduced through cheap hosts, throughput can greatly increase due to parallelism, and reliability can greatly increase just by paying multiple hosts to store the data. By default, the Sia renter uploads each file 3 times, so 3x redundancy. Though it is a tad more complex than that because it also uses erasure coding to increase reliability. Also Skynet uses 10x redundancy because 3x wasn\u2019t fast enough when it was initially created. Learn more in Introduction to Skynet . Though this is actually changing. Basically, the base sector(used to find the file on the hosts) is going to stay at 10x redundancy, but for anthing over that it will be stored in a 3x(10 of 30) redundancy scheme to lower costs. For something like video streaming, the origional 4MB sector should store a couple seconds worth of video(5 seconds at 8mbps) which should give siad plenty of time to find the location of the rest of the sectors.","title":"Redundancy"},{"location":"sia/renting/index.html#storage-contracts","text":"Storage contracts are the magic that make Sia a truly permissionless storage network. On a high level, a storage contract is a payment channel between the renter and host with some metadata on top of it; for more info on payment channels listen to this talk . For those that don\u2019t feel like watching that, but want the gist of payment channels, effectively one party puts in a certain amount of crypto into a \u201csmart contract.\u201d This money is unavailable until the arbitrary end date of this contract when it will be resolved. Whenever the sender(in this case the renter node), wants to send money, instead of sending a transaction over the network and having to wait an hour for multiple confirmations, the sender just adds some coin to the \u201csent\u201d section of the payment contract, then signs it. The other party(in this case the host) sees this signed contract, and knows that it can safely broadcast this later to get the money inside the channel. The sender cannot revoke this money sent because it has already signed it, and it cannot be iterated downwards, because the receiver could always just broadcast the transaction with more money to make more money. So this is safe way to send money with latency in milliseconds instead of hours. Anyhow, storage contracts have one other thing built in that makes them special in comparison to plain payment channels. This is the storage proof. What this means is that the host doesn\u2019t only have to have the signature of the renter in order to take the money from the channel, but they have to prove that they still have the data from the renter by submitting a Merkle tree root that combines a hash of the data and some entropy to make sure that they cannot prove it in advance. I\u2019m gonna stop here because it can get incredibly complex and nuanced, and you can learn more about it here . But, basically, just know that the storage contract is the thing that allows the Sia network to function without trust. One more thing to note. It is often brought up how the minimum sector size with Sia is 4 MiB. And the reason the team originally made this decision is actually because of the limitations of the storage contract. You can read more about it from Luke here . The basic idea was that Sia was originally based on 64B \u201csegments\u201d, but since storing one Merkle root is 32B, this made it so if you were storing 2TB of data, you\u2019d have to store 1TB of metadata. They quickly saw this for what it was, a big issue. So in order to solve this problem, they tried to take a middle ground in \u201csector\u201d size and take the root of that instead of the \u201csegment.\u201d They chose 4MiB as a nice middle ground between metadata size and performance arbitrarily. So if you now upload any file, it\u2019ll be padded to 4MiB no matter the size in order to fit inside that sector. This is being actively worked on to be reduced.","title":"Storage contracts"},{"location":"sia/renting/index.html#erasure-coding","text":"Erasure coding is the second trick Sia uses to increase the availability of data. For a technical explanation, read this . If you didn\u2019t read that the basic idea is this, fragmentation of data provides a far greater amount of reliability than redundancy does. So in order to take advantage of that, a normal Sia renter node uses a 10 of 30 scheme. So basically, instead of just uploading each sector to a different node 3 times, it does fancy math to zip-tie 10 sectors together make it so any 10 of the 30 uploaded sectors can retrieve the data of what was originally put in. Unfortunately, this does come at the cost of increasing the minimum file size to 40MB, but the devs thought it okay to do that because it made the renter node much more reliable. Side note, Skynet does not use erasure coding because it wasn\u2019t fast enough on release, learn more in Introduction to Skynet . Again, as stated earlier, this is somewhat changing.","title":"Erasure coding"},{"location":"sia/renting/index.html#encryption","text":"Encryption is effectively just fancy math that allows you to take data and a \u201cpassword\u201d(also knows as a private key), then turn that into another piece of data that can only be viewed if you have the corresponding private key.

Technical details aside, the use of encryption makes it so you can safely send sensitive data to hosts without worry of them being able to view it. You never send the private key of your data to the host, so to them it\u2019s just random jibber-jabber that they get paid to store.

It doesn\u2019t matter if you use Sia, or Bitcoin or anything else. This guide will help you to do it securely. Not your keys, not your coins Managing your keys is extremely important, and many people don\u2019t take it as seriously as they should. I\u2019m not saying this to scare you, but in the crypto-world, for decentralized blockchains there is nothing like ownership based on your identity and there is no number you can call to ask for access or refund. You have absolute power over \u201c your \u201d assets, but also absolute responsibility. The private key, in the world of Sia called a seed is a unique sequence of words that is used to generate wallet addresses and process the transactions of your wallet. Every single seed lets you manage exactly one wallet (1:1 relation) and every wallet lets you create many wallet addresses (1:many relation). You\u2019ve maybe heard it \u2013 \u201cnot your keys, not your coins.\u201d It\u2019s best known in reference to exchanges that effectively manage the keys for you. It\u2019s like giving someone else your wallet and asking them when you can use your money. Sometimes they\u2019ll be around, sometimes they won\u2019t. Nothing is safer than holding your own coins and being the only one with the seed. All you need is to make sure it survives the most common disaster scenarios like computer failure, physical loss of the paper you wrote it on, mistakes in writing it down or even your own death. The last one is most tricky. Wondering why you cannot see your recent transactions? That\u2019s because there is no centralized server to ask. When you load your wallet from the seed, Sia-UI scans entire blockchain (transaction by transaction) and every transaction matching your seed\u2019s signature is remembered locally on your computer and used to count your current balance as a sum of all incoming and outgoing transactions. This also explains why you need to wait until you are 100% synchronized (especially if you made some transaction recently), because only then your local copy of the blockchain knows all transactions to show you correct current balance. By now, it should be crystal clear to you that protection of your seed is your own responsibility and no one else should do this for you. But no worries, it\u2019s not as hard and scary as it sounds. The only reason to worry is if you ignore this advice. Preserving your seed So how do you keep a string of words safe? You have many options like writing it down on paper, embossing it into metal, putting it in your last will and let a legal firm protect it, or other ways. You can even split it into several pieces or combinations where you might need any two of three, but that depends on you and what risks you can live with. Each has pros and cons, but I\u2019m going to share with you a method I personally find quite good and requires low effort for a vast majority of users. After all, simplicity is the ultimate form of sophistication. So, how do you store your seeds, keys, passwords or even important files and documents? Obtain a password manager that lets you have a local encrypted database protected by a custom password. In this example we will use KeePass. It is free, open source, easy to use and has several implementations available for each platform. I personally use KeePassX on MacOS, but you can use any other implementation or even a different password manager that lets you use an encrypted database protected by password. Create master password . You can come up with your own password, but the most secure method of doing so is to draw from a large list of words that might not normally be in your vocabulary. Longer passwords are inherently more secure, and using random words instead of ones you pick reduces the likelihood that it could be brute forced. One password to rule them all The point of the master password is to create a security layer and a place where you can keep your most important data. The longer a password is, the better. There are a variety of password strength checkers online, and each of them will return different results, but an easy to remember password consisting of multiple words without any special characters is stronger than a hard to remember password consisting of multiple numbers and symbols. In this case I suggest to use it only for the most sensitive information that you won\u2019t access a lot (like your Sia seed), but if you want to use it for other data too, just repeat the process and create a second password and database. Find a list of words like this one where you can see numbers and words. Don\u2019t use any automated generator or even random number generator in the process we describe below. Just find a physical 6-sided dice and stick with it. If you have five of them, it will be faster, but you can do the same just with one. Then take a paper and a pen and start rolling your dice to create a truly random sequence of five numbers. If you roll this as your first sequence \u2014 1, 1, 1, 1, 2 \u2014 your word would be \u201cabdomen\u201d. Repeat this 7\u20139 times depending on how many words you want to have in your password. You can also read more details about coming with random numbers in this article on the Sia blog . Pair each sequence with a word from the list. Let\u2019s say your words are: monastery sudoku zombie bucket amazingly amount debate (sorry if it\u2019s someone password). You can memorize it like this if you want, or you can include non-random words and even replace some to create a long secure phrase, but easy to remember. Like: \u201c amount of zombies with buckets debate amazingly in sudoku monastery \u201d. It\u2019s like creating a random set of words and then putting it together in some kind of absurd story you can very easily memorize. xkcd had a great comic on this topic. You can write it on paper and repeat . Once confident you remember it, destroy the paper or emboss it into some durable and water/fire/physical damage resistant material (here is excellent stress test by Jameson Lopp ) and hide while letting only your closest ones to know where to find it (preferably in a fireproof safe). It should take you about three minutes to memorize it and it\u2019s good practice to repeat if every few hours, then days until you are 100% sure. Share this master password and its location only with someone you absolutely trust, someone who should be able to find it if something happened to you. Open your password manager (I use KeePassX) and create a new database protected by your master password . Remember, this will be the only place where you will ever enter your master password. If you want to increase security even further, run this on computer that will never get connected to the internet. Once you get the database file created, add any information you want to protect . Seeds and private keys, exchange credentials, wallet files or other information you rarely access, but let you control your assets. You can also write instructions and notes for yourself, or even for those who would read it in case you couldn\u2019t, so the assets wouldn\u2019t be lost permanently and continue to hands of other family members for example. You can even leave advice on how to make sure that it will get passed properly to further generations. These notes can contain information about your contracts and other assets, for example if you are mining. You can hide all of this behind one super secure password. Kind of a digital last will. Now that your database is ready, you should create a backup. If you run it on a computer without internet, make backups on flash drives or local network drives. You can use a timestamp for these backups to know when they were made (I usually never delete older versions, keep them all as there is nothing bad in having it multiple times, but only recent ones contain everything), so the database can be named liked \u201cKeePass_31_12_18\u201d. If you run it on a computer with an internet connection, you can even use some service like iCloud or Google Drive to have it automatically backed up in cloud (linked to your identity and belonging to you which makes it easier for you to get to it from anywhere if needed). Just one warning, if you are unable or worried to keep your computer protected from crypto-viruses, keyloggers and remote-control and you have a significant amount of money in crypto, think about using a separate machine for this that will never connect to internet. Better be safe than sorry, because if anyone gets to both your database and the password, you have a problem. So\u2026 now you are able to save important data without worries and always be able to recover them (even remotely if you had to run away with empty hands and only your master password in your head). And (optionally) you instructed your close ones where they can find the database (drives or cloud) and master password (locked in place that noone can get to without you noticing). Be careful who you give these information to, but this is the kind of stuff you would want included in your last will if you want to make sure someone gets to it while you are alive \u2014 the location of databases and where to find the password.

Written by: Danger & Covalent, Last Edit: April 14, 2021","title":"One password to rule them all"},{"location":"sia/tokenomics/index.html","text":"Tokenomics (SC & SF) There is a lot of misunderstanding around when it comes to tokens flowing through the Sia network. Most common concern is about its so called \u201cunlimited\u201d supply and inflation. So let\u2019s take a deeper look at it. Quick Links: Siacoin (SC) , Siafund (SF) , Where to buy? Siacoin (SC) The first and most common mistake we see all the time is people calling the currency SIA , the same name as the network. It seems to make sense to them if they only hold it, but is very confusing to anyone actually using it. The network is called Sia and the currency enabling us to use it is Siacoin with SC as the ticker symbol commonly used on exchanges. Siacoin is a cryptocurrency that was never pre-mined, there was no ICO and it is not a trusted setup. Siacoins are not even securities. In 2019 SEC was looking into Sia and didn\u2019t initiate any action against SC. Only issues they had were with the first and very small $120,000 Sianotes (later converted to Siafunds) offering from 2014, few years before SEC even started providing guidance to projects in 2017. Siacoin can be divided up tp 10^24 units called hastings and is only entering circulation as a result of mining. You can find more details about it in our Mining Guide . Symbol Prefix Full amount Scientific notation H hasting 0.000000000000000000000001 SC 10^-24 SC pS pico 0.000000000001 SC 10^-12 SC nS nano 0.000000001 SC 10^-9 SC \u03bcS micro 0.000001 SC 10^-6 SC mS milli 0.001 SC 10^-3 SC SC Siacoin 1 SC 10^1 SC KS kilo 1000 SC 10^3 SC MS mega 1000000 SC 10^6 SC GS giga 1000000000 SC 10^9 SC TS tera 1000000000000 SC 10^12 SC Did you know? Not many projects can say that they never participated in any paid listings on exchanges. Sia is a rare example of such project that accomplished it purely for its fundamentals. How they get made Those who earn the new coins by mining do it as a paid service. They buy and use expensive hardware with a single purpose\u200a \u2013 \u200amining crypto. It\u2019s a very specific device because it cannot be used for anything else. But it provides an important security layer to the network by powering the transactions that take place. They earn Siacoin (SC) as their mining reward and then distribute it with profit to the broader community, usually via exchanges. For those who know Bitcoin, this is the same process, but with its own network and Proof of Work algorithm. The only difference is that while Bitcoin has a limit of coins that can be mined, Siacoin doesn\u2019t. And because this is something that makes newcomers to Sia worried, let\u2019s look at it in more detail. Is the supply really unlimited? Many people have concerns about unlimited supply of Siacoin and its inflation. These concerns have roots in lack of understanding and can be easily dismissed. There is always going to be some block reward to ensure that there are new coins entering circulation. Remember, this is not just a currency like Bitcoin, this is a data storage network. If it becomes successful, it can happen that a majority of the coins will be locked in storage contracts . There are also concerns about the other extreme, risk of someone accumulating and holding majority, if not all of the Siacoins. This all has been foreseen and by design the supply has been made \u201cunlimited\u201d. However, \u201cunlimited\u201d supply doesn\u2019t mean you can \u201cprint\u201d endless amount of coins right now . It means that there is no limit and coins will keep entering circulation at known rate. As you know the block reward, you can tell how many coins there will be in the existence at any point in time. And you can achieve really infinite supply only if you have infinite time. But the human kind doesn\u2019t have such life expectation. In our lifetimes, the total supply of Siacoin won\u2019t increase much. And that is correct even if Sia Foundation adds extra coins to the block rewards. In 2015, Sia\u2019s block reward started with genesis block at 300,000 SC and was decreasing by 1 with each new block. The bottom by design was set to 30 000 SC per block and this limit was reached in 2020. Since then the block reward is fixed. In Q1 of 2021 this is changing with Sia Foundation, (you can find more about it in Introduction to Sia ) but even with block reward doubled to 60 000 SC per block the inflation will be much lower than for other projects and actually lower than it wasthen it was a couple years ago. Not just that though, half of these coins will be used for good of the network and if it cannot be reasonably and transparently spent in its support, it will be burnt. Ask yourself, if you knew year ago that 50% of block rewards are going into support of the Sia ecosystem instead of profit taking (where money leave the ecosystem), wouldn\u2019t it be great news ? The existence of the block reward guarantees that the network can continue performing smoothly and users always have the option of either buying it on exchange, using some middleman (storage services built on top of Sia and providing fiat payment gates), or mining it themselves. This helps to keep everything working and self-balancing. Another self-balancing technique that the network uses is coin destruction. Some coins are burnt by host announcements and lost in collateral from bad-actor hosts. What is a 51% attack and is it a threat or not? There is one question that is brought up constantly since many other projects were affected by it, especially those allowing GPU mining or algorithms shared by many projects allowing hashrate to be easily rented just for those attacks. A 51% attack is when a malicious party controls more than 50% of the network\u2019s hashrate. This allows the attacker to rewrite the blockchain history. The most common form of this attack is the \u201cdouble-spend attack\u201d, where the attacker pays a counterparty, then rewinds the blockchain history to \u201cundo\u201d their payment. All proof-of-work blockchains are vulnerable to 51% attacks, but Sia is more secure than most PoW chains because of it's employment of ASICs . Before ASICs for Sia were released, mining was performed with GPUs. This left the network vulnerable to large GPU mining pools whose total hashrate exceeded 50% of Sia\u2019s hashrate. Recognizing this threat, Nebulous spun off a subsidiary company, Obelisk and started a public fundraising in order to develop and deliver ASIC miners for Sia. Obelisk was careful to prevent any one entity from controlling too many of these ASICs, but the situation dramatically changed long before their delivery as other manufacturers noticed the public announcement of ASICs being made for Sia and rushed in with inferior, but sooner delivered units. They flooded Sia\u2019s ecosystem with way more than was healthy and even competed with own customers. About half year later, when one such manufacturer got close to 50% of block rewards moving into single wallet address without even trying to hide it, there was no other option and the community unanymously forked anything but Obelisk SC1 away from the network. Today, there are still many Obelisks on the network but majority of hashrate is from other products that have become available for Sia as well. As a result, Sia\u2019s hashrate is well-distributed. At this point, in order for a 51% attack to be performed, an attacker would need to control multiple mining pools, and/or develop custom ASICs at enormous expense. If you want to know more about hardware available for mining and learn more about the history of mining and forks, see our Mining Hardware guide . But miners are just where it begins. You probably know that when it comes to decentralized storage, your paper currency is quite useless. Not even the funds on your bank account can help you as there is no payment gateway. Some other projects have them and those gateways are the points of failure, because if they go down, you cannot access your files. The importance of Sia having its own currency And that\u2019s where Siacoins come into play. It is a cryptocurrency specifically designed for this kind of service. Its blockchain supports storage contracts so you can form these with the selected hosts directly. Once the contract is formed, all payments between you and the other side are instant through the payment channel and in the near future there will even be pre-payments possible. Thanks to this you only pay for what you really use. We believe this is beginning of the internet where you have the option to pay tiny micro-transactions only for content you see instead of blanket subscription fees. However, this doesn\u2019t mean you won\u2019t have that option. In this new world, it is up to users to decide. Services built with this tech can offer such experience for those who want to use the decentralized internet without worrying about crypto wallet management and just pay with fiat currency. And the recent development with Skynet makes this future look like coming true. If you want to know more about Skynet, see our Introduction to Skynet . What makes hosts to keep and protect my data instead of deleting them? Hosts also use Siacoin. For them it is not just a reward. Before they get chance to store any of your data, they must provide a collateral. If you met a stranger on the street that would tell you that he will keep and protect your phone if you give it to him, would you trust him without giving you something of at least same value? And would you trust a stranger with your most precious data? We don\u2019t think so. While there are many good people, you would most likely lose your phone and never see your data again as well. This is why the incentives must be set right, especially in decentralized system that claims to have no point of failure. In a good faith, hosts need to provide collateral which is usually about two times higher than expected earnings for the rented storage. The host will get his collateral back as well as the earnings only if he keeps providing proofs that he still holds your data until the contract duration expires. This is usually called a successful storage contract. On the other side, if it fails, the collateral and expected earnings are burnt. This is why hosting is considered a serious and responsible job, because if you cannot protect user\u2019s data, you are going to lose money. And that makes sense, right? Is it a good investment? Very often people ask if Siacoin (SC) is a good investment. They also remember that developers said they don\u2019t care about the price. While we won\u2019t give you financial advice, we can provide some facts and views that might improve your understanding and enable you to make own judgement and decisions. The way Sia works, all coins in circulation were mined by community (miners). The developers had less than 1% of coins but accidentaly lost them and since then they have less than 0.1% of entire supply. They don\u2019t participate in speculation, they are probably one of few super rare projects that never paid a single cent for any of the listings on exchanges. And their incentives are the Siafunds (and since 2021 also Skynet business model) which only start generating meaningful income when the network gets more used. And guess what, Siafunds are paying rewards in SC. Simply said, Sia developers are not in control of the network, markets or price and are very motivated to make Sia succeed in order to generate income in SC. Say what you want, but it is clear that they care about price of SC but what we think they wanted to say is that they are not in control and cannot affect it other way than by their hard work and more people using Sia. The price depends only on supply and demand and markets are tools to help traders discover it. Siafund (SF) Siafund is a supplementary token of the Sia network with only 10,000 SF that will ever be in existence. Unlike Siacoins, which can be divided up, a single SF cannot be split. They are only transferred or held in whole units. You can hold it in the same wallet, but will never see it mentioned (at least in Sia-UI) unless you have one. These tokens are securities, and you can read more about the landmark 2019 SEC settlement that declared them so . They are used for revenue sharing on the Sia network; a 3.9% fee from every storage-related transaction on Sia is distributed to the holders of Siafunds. The developers (Skynet Labs) currently hold approximately 85% of all Siafunds while the remaining approx. 1,500 SF were distributed to the community in a total of three offerings since 2014. Where to buy? If you are interested in buying Siacoin or Siafund, check our Trading guide . It will lead you through everything you need to to know in order to securely and responsibly manage your assets and execute trade orders.

The network is called Sia and the currency enabling us to use it is Siacoin with SC as the ticker symbol commonly used on exchanges. Siacoin is a cryptocurrency that was never pre-mined, there was no ICO and it is not a trusted setup. Siacoins are not even securities. In 2019 SEC was looking into Sia and didn\u2019t initiate any action against SC. Only issues they had were with the first and very small $120,000 Sianotes (later converted to Siafunds) offering from 2014, few years before SEC even started providing guidance to projects in 2017. Siacoin can be divided up tp 10^24 units called hastings and is only entering circulation as a result of mining. You can find more details about it in our Mining Guide .

But it provides an important security layer to the network by powering the transactions that take place. They earn Siacoin (SC) as their mining reward and then distribute it with profit to the broader community, usually via exchanges. For those who know Bitcoin, this is the same process, but with its own network and Proof of Work algorithm. The only difference is that while Bitcoin has a limit of coins that can be mined, Siacoin doesn\u2019t. And because this is something that makes newcomers to Sia worried, let\u2019s look at it in more detail.","title":"How they get made"},{"location":"sia/tokenomics/index.html#is-the-supply-really-unlimited","text":"Many people have concerns about unlimited supply of Siacoin and its inflation. These concerns have roots in lack of understanding and can be easily dismissed. There is always going to be some block reward to ensure that there are new coins entering circulation. Remember, this is not just a currency like Bitcoin, this is a data storage network. If it becomes successful, it can happen that a majority of the coins will be locked in storage contracts . There are also concerns about the other extreme, risk of someone accumulating and holding majority, if not all of the Siacoins. This all has been foreseen and by design the supply has been made \u201cunlimited\u201d. However, \u201cunlimited\u201d supply doesn\u2019t mean you can \u201cprint\u201d endless amount of coins right now . It means that there is no limit and coins will keep entering circulation at known rate. As you know the block reward, you can tell how many coins there will be in the existence at any point in time. And you can achieve really infinite supply only if you have infinite time. But the human kind doesn\u2019t have such life expectation. In our lifetimes, the total supply of Siacoin won\u2019t increase much. And that is correct even if Sia Foundation adds extra coins to the block rewards. In 2015, Sia\u2019s block reward started with genesis block at 300,000 SC and was decreasing by 1 with each new block. The bottom by design was set to 30 000 SC per block and this limit was reached in 2020. Since then the block reward is fixed. In Q1 of 2021 this is changing with Sia Foundation, (you can find more about it in Introduction to Sia ) but even with block reward doubled to 60 000 SC per block the inflation will be much lower than for other projects and actually lower than it wasthen it was a couple years ago. Not just that though, half of these coins will be used for good of the network and if it cannot be reasonably and transparently spent in its support, it will be burnt. Ask yourself, if you knew year ago that 50% of block rewards are going into support of the Sia ecosystem instead of profit taking (where money leave the ecosystem), wouldn\u2019t it be great news ?

While IT IS NOT MEANT AS FINANCIAL ADVICE , it will try to get you familiar with most of the knowledge that our contributors accumulated during the years spent in crypto world. Maybe it helps you to do better educated decisions instead of rushed ones. Where to buy Siacoin (SC)? You can buy Siacoin on many exchanges. There are three options: Buy SC with BTC, this is supported by majority of exchanges and is the simplest option if you have - BTC or can get some (on same, or different exchange) Buy SC with ETH or other altcoins that your exchange offers in pair with SC Buy SC with fiat (USD, EUR, etc.) Not all of these options are available on all exchanges, but many exchanges offer them. You can find list of exchanges here . You can also check CoinMarketCap . You can also visit the Sia discord and ask in #trading channel for help to get assistance from other users with up to date information. This might be especially useful for NY residents who have more complicated access to crypto due to their regulation. Most of the recommended exchanges allow users to directly buy crypto for fiat currency. Some let you buy SC directly (for example Transak , but it is not an traditional exchange, it is fiat/crypto gateway), with others you need to buy BTC or ETH first and then trade it for SC. Most often used exchanges by our english speaking community are Binance, Bittrex and Kraken and quite popular among Koreans seems to be Upbit. If you decided what exchange you will use, continue with Getting Verified or skip directly to Market Orders . Where to buy Siafund (SF)? Since there is not many Siafunds and they are rather expensive asset, they are quite illiquid and there is only few trades happening per year. This asset doesn\u2019t change hands frequently. One way to get these is by using Bisq, decentralized exchange. Other way is on official Sia discord where you can use Escrow to assist you. If you\u2019re not sure, you can always ask there in #siafund channel and get help. However, be aware to never continue in conversation with someone who contains you first, even if he has picture and name of known person (like moderator or developer). These are scammers. You should always be the one who checks the user list and color (role on server cannot be faked) and initiates such discussion. Remember that sending SF is same as sending SC. They can be sent in same transaction as SC since the Sia blockchain supports both of these tokens. If you get to own one, you need to pay extra attention when sending SC to not accidentally select SF because once you own SF, it will start appearing in your Sia-UI wallet (only wallet that supports it currently). Getting Verified As vast majority of exchanges is regulated, so called KYC is required. It stands for Know Your Customer and exchanges are required by law to know your identity in order to provide you any service. You will be asked to provide documents proving your identity like scans of ID and additional resources for the exchange to be sure it is not a fake person or an impostor. This step of guide is here to let you know this is standard and required procedure. Some Exchanges even have mobile apps that will make entire experience much simpler and user friendly for you. Once verified, it is also great idea to enable 2-Factor-Authentication on the Exchange. You can usually select between SMS and Google Authenticator . And since there were many victims of attackers that called to user\u2019s operator and got control of user\u2019s phone number due to poor security of said operators, it is recommended to go with the Google Authenticator option. It is also a good practice to securely store the seed used for the Google Authenticator\u2019s code generator so you can get to it when needed in case you lost your device. To learn more about storing such values scurely check our Secure Seed Management guide . Market Orders Markets are tools for discovery of the price. Market is a place where supply and demand meets and affects price of an asset. This is done by using so called orders. Many of these are made by people and even more by bots that balance the prices between different exchanges and markets. Whenever there is price move, there is an opportunity and this process is called arbitraging. Whenever you want to buy, you create Buy Order. When you want to sell, you create Sell Order. There are multiple types of these such as Limit, Market. There are also leveraged orders allowing you to trade with borrowed assets while you provide only part of it. For example, if the you buy with 10x leverage, you can easily double your assets if price moves up by 10% (100/10), but you can lose it all when it moves down by 10% as well. Such event is called forced liquidation and it means you lost your \u201cbet\u201d. Exchange automatically liquidates your position in order to pay back the asset you lost and return it to those who lended it to you through automated process. We do not recommend leverage trading, since you can easily lose everything. Let\u2019s focus on the most common orders. Limit orders let you specify conditions at which the order will be filled. Once you create such order, you will be able to see it in the order book where it will stay until someone fills it with counter-order with same price. This can happen instantly if such order already exists or it might not happen ever. Some orders can be not realistical and will never met with anyone to fill it. If you are not sure, easiest way is to just use Market Buy Order or Market Sell Order . You just specify the amount you want and you will instantly buy or sell at best prices according to already existing orders. Your coins will then appear in the Wallet section. If you want to know how to store, send and receive them, check our Siacoin Wallets guide . Mistakes to avoid Don\u2019t access exchange links from third party sources. Be aware that fake exchange links can appear even on google search as paid advertisement. Bookmark your exchange and use that. You can avoid this issue getting used to official mobile apps. Never trust anyone and never talk about your crypto unless aware of consequences. You can become a target of social engineering. When asked by anyone, think about it twice \u2013 if it\u2019s too good to be true, it probably isn\u2019t. Someone might contact you because he can\u2019t get to his BTC and if you help him, he can split it with you. But there is always an catch. Don\u2019t go for it. And if you ever got email from someone asking for ransom because he got access to your computer and made intimate photos, don\u2019t trust it. It\u2019s just smart spam hoping that someone will get afraid, get some BTC and send it to the scammer. Don\u2019t participate in so called pumps & dumps or get tricked to invest in so called shitcoins. Always try to look through the curtain, think about motivation of others. While Bitcoin and Sia are solid projects, not many others are. They are always looking for the next moron that drives the price higher \u2013 and then they dump it on you. Be greedy when others are fearful, be fearful when others are greedy. How to understand this? Try to zoom out. If you see some asset just went through exponential growth and everyone, including your non-crypto friends and family talks about it with excitement, be careful and try to look for market indicators that professional traders use since the trend reversal or price correction might be imminent. This is called buying at the top and you can ask 2017 traders how did they feel about buying at $20,000. In long term it likely won\u2019t matter, but in short term you will panic and be devastated. Opposite of this is selling at the bottom. While this is not a financial advice, looking at the Siacoin market clearly shows 3 year long bear market and majority of traders is probably very fearful. Is this time to get greedy? Your call. We can only provide you with resources for project with the most advanced technology and best looking fundamentals in entire crypto space.

Once verified, it is also great idea to enable 2-Factor-Authentication on the Exchange. You can usually select between SMS and Google Authenticator . And since there were many victims of attackers that called to user\u2019s operator and got control of user\u2019s phone number due to poor security of said operators, it is recommended to go with the Google Authenticator option. It is also a good practice to securely store the seed used for the Google Authenticator\u2019s code generator so you can get to it when needed in case you lost your device. To learn more about storing such values scurely check our Secure Seed Management guide .","title":"Getting Verified"},{"location":"sia/trading/index.html#market-orders","text":"Markets are tools for discovery of the price. Market is a place where supply and demand meets and affects price of an asset. This is done by using so called orders. Many of these are made by people and even more by bots that balance the prices between different exchanges and markets. Whenever there is price move, there is an opportunity and this process is called arbitraging. Whenever you want to buy, you create Buy Order. When you want to sell, you create Sell Order. There are multiple types of these such as Limit, Market. There are also leveraged orders allowing you to trade with borrowed assets while you provide only part of it. For example, if the you buy with 10x leverage, you can easily double your assets if price moves up by 10% (100/10), but you can lose it all when it moves down by 10% as well. Such event is called forced liquidation and it means you lost your \u201cbet\u201d. Exchange automatically liquidates your position in order to pay back the asset you lost and return it to those who lended it to you through automated process. We do not recommend leverage trading, since you can easily lose everything. Let\u2019s focus on the most common orders. Limit orders let you specify conditions at which the order will be filled. Once you create such order, you will be able to see it in the order book where it will stay until someone fills it with counter-order with same price. This can happen instantly if such order already exists or it might not happen ever. Some orders can be not realistical and will never met with anyone to fill it. If you are not sure, easiest way is to just use Market Buy Order or Market Sell Order . You just specify the amount you want and you will instantly buy or sell at best prices according to already existing orders. Your coins will then appear in the Wallet section. If you want to know how to store, send and receive them, check our Siacoin Wallets guide .","title":"Market Orders"},{"location":"sia/trading/index.html#mistakes-to-avoid","text":"Don\u2019t access exchange links from third party sources. Be aware that fake exchange links can appear even on google search as paid advertisement. Bookmark your exchange and use that. You can avoid this issue getting used to official mobile apps. Never trust anyone and never talk about your crypto unless aware of consequences. You can become a target of social engineering. When asked by anyone, think about it twice \u2013 if it\u2019s too good to be true, it probably isn\u2019t. Someone might contact you because he can\u2019t get to his BTC and if you help him, he can split it with you. But there is always an catch. Don\u2019t go for it. And if you ever got email from someone asking for ransom because he got access to your computer and made intimate photos, don\u2019t trust it. It\u2019s just smart spam hoping that someone will get afraid, get some BTC and send it to the scammer. Don\u2019t participate in so called pumps & dumps or get tricked to invest in so called shitcoins. Always try to look through the curtain, think about motivation of others. While Bitcoin and Sia are solid projects, not many others are. They are always looking for the next moron that drives the price higher \u2013 and then they dump it on you. Be greedy when others are fearful, be fearful when others are greedy. How to understand this? Try to zoom out. If you see some asset just went through exponential growth and everyone, including your non-crypto friends and family talks about it with excitement, be careful and try to look for market indicators that professional traders use since the trend reversal or price correction might be imminent. This is called buying at the top and you can ask 2017 traders how did they feel about buying at $20,000. In long term it likely won\u2019t matter, but in short term you will panic and be devastated. Opposite of this is selling at the bottom. While this is not a financial advice, looking at the Siacoin market clearly shows 3 year long bear market and majority of traders is probably very fearful. Is this time to get greedy? Your call. We can only provide you with resources for project with the most advanced technology and best looking fundamentals in entire crypto space.

Quick Links: How to store Siacoin? ( Sia-UI , Sia Central ), How to receive SC? , How to send SC ? How to store Siacoin? Sia-UI Available for : Windows, MacOS, Linux Sia-UI is the official and recommended way of accessing you Sia Wallet. It is the visual layer (also known as UI, or User Interace) on top of Siad (Sia Daemon) , software that is operated by many users around the globe and pumping life to the constantly running Sia network. If you are looking for CLI (Command Line Interface) instead, check our Mastering Sia with CLI guide. First thing to do is to visit the website and download latest version of Sia-UI for your OS (Operating System) . This guide is written for 1.4.0 or higher at the time of 1.5.3 being the latest version available. Launch Sia-UI and once you see the options to create wallet or recover it from a seed, select the option to Create Wallet . It will present you with 29-word seed and force you to write it down. This 29-word seed is the only information you will ever need to regain access to your wallet. Save your 29-word seed in a password manager of your choice to make sure it's secure and available after a possible system faliure (see Secure Seed Management guide ). You can also include any notes like where to download it or copy/paste content or link of this article. Backup your password manager\u2018s database . Once you save this new item in your database under name like \u201cSia Wallet [Seed]\u201d, what I usually do is to duplicate that item and name it \u201cSia Wallet [Seed Backup]\u201d. Just in case you ever accidentally deleted any of these two. Then save the database, update it\u2019s timestamp like \u201cKeePass_01_05_19\u201d and save it to all the places and devices you decided to. Two are absolute minimum, 3\u20134 work best. Unlock your wallet by entering the seed into the password field. Once you do so, you can click more and then change your password . Just remember that it will work only locally on this specific computer and only until you load any wallet from the seed again. If you ever get into situation when your password is not accepted and you are 100% sure it was your password, just enter your seed in format word1 word2 word3 \u2026 word27 word28 word29 . Congratulations, you\u2019ve successfully created Sia wallet and are ready to receive your first Siacoins (SC). Right now you can already generate wallet address by clicking Receive but you will still need to be 100% synced in order to see any incoming transaction and be able to send some. Let\u2019s say you want to know what to do if you lose your custom password . That\u2019s easy, just load your wallet from your seed and then enter your seed again when asked for password. Because the seed is your default password after loading a wallet from a seed. You can find answers in our detailed FAQ . If you already had an earlier Sia-UI version installed on your computer , you might run into some issues with synchronization due to past hard forks. In such case, remember that your seed is the key and Sia-UI just a tool that can work only when it has correctly synchronized data. You can always re-sync to correct blockchain and get access to your wallet just by clearing it\u2019s data, installing latest version, letting it sync and then using it to load wallet from a seed. It is called clean installation and you can find instructions in our FAQ . If you want to have multiple wallets and switch between them time from time, these two commands will be useful for you: wallet init --force instantly creates new wallet and shows you new seed, while wallet init-seed --force lets you load your existing wallet from a seed. You can use these from Terminal inside Sia-UI and remember that the expected password then is going to be the same as your seed. It is not recommended to try to run same wallet on multiple computers at once, especially if you are hosting or renting. Blockchain can usually hold just one currency and cannot be mixed with another one or even separate forks (having own unique currency since that point). But in case of Sia there is one exception. It is the supplementary token known as Siafund (SF) and Sia wallet can hold both SC and SF. You can read more about Siafund in Tokenomics . Sia Central Available for : Any platform with Web Browser Sia Central Lite Wallet was introduced in 2020 by Community member Nate , author of Sia Host Manager. It is the most user friendly way of sending and receiving Siacoins. It lets you use it straight away from your browser without syncing anything. You just enter your seed or create new one and that\u2019s it. While it is secure and your seed never leaves your computer, it is only as secure as your computer is. Fortunately, it has a feature that lets every user enjoy top tier security. It supports Ledger Nano S so your seed never leaves you hardware wallet and you can use it securely even if you\u2019re not friendly with technologies. You can find detailed guide including pictures here: Sending Siacoins with Ledger Nano S . Other Wallets If you found a Sia wallet not mentioned in this list, you should pay increased attention. While there were some working wallets in the past (there was/is one for Android that even allowed you to sync blockchain), there were also some scams. Even if it\u2019s not so comfortable as getting such third party wallet on platform of your preference, it is recommended to use one of the options above. With Sia Foundation taking over further development of Sia starting in 2020, it is expected that in the next year Sia will get Utreexo introduced, a feature dramatically reducing blockchain requirements and making sync times nearly instant. It is seen as pre-requisite for turning every single device including your phone into Sia node and opening of new world of possibilities. How to receive Siacoin? Receiving at Exchange Find Wallet or Deposit section and select coin you want to receive ( deposit ). You will know you did it right when it shows you wallet address and by double checking it you can confirm that the coin is really Siacoin (SC). Copy this address into clipboard and remember few of its first and last characters. Then provide this wallet address to person or wallet you want to receive coins from. If you are the recipient and you are just sending coins between your different wallets, continue with the following section How to send Siacoin? and copy/paste (and then check if it is correct) this value into wallet address (sometimes called recipient's address ) field. It is good idea to never keep your coins on Exchange unless you are trading actively and you know what you are doing. It is rather rare today but many exchanges in the past ended up with users losing their assets. When you have coins on Exchange, they are not really yours since you don\u2019t have the seed (private key). It is very similar to your bank account, the money are not yours. It is the bank that keeps them and allows you access it through its system. If that system goes down, what will you do? You can prevent this scenario by keeping coins in your own wallet out of exchanges. Receiving with Sia-UI or Sia Central When your wallet is unlocked, just find the Receive button (in Sia-UI it is under Wallet section) and see the wallet address generated. Then provide this wallet address to person or wallet you want to receive coins from. This wallet address was generated with your seed (private key) and any transaction sent to it will belong to it. It means that if you recover your wallet on other computer from seed, you will see your coins again. You don\u2019t need anything but your seed. Losing your seed means loss of access to your coins and no one can help you so make sure to store it securely. Feel free to check our guide about Secure Seed Management . If you use Sia-UI, you won\u2019t see the incoming transaction until 100% synced. This process can take a lot of time, even up to a week if you don\u2019t have SSD drive. If it\u2019s your case, check our FAQ for How can I get synced faster ? How to send Siacoin? Sending from Exchange Even if every exchange is different and buttons can have different labels, basics are all the same. You need to find Wallet or Withdrawal section and select a coin you want to send ( withdraw ). Once you do so, you need to enter recipient\u2019s Siacoin wallet address . Remember always to double or triple check the address that it matches the one you want to send it to. Fast way to do so is to check first and last characters so you know for sure you didn\u2019t miss any. Sending from Sia-UI Click Wallet tab on the left side and then Send in the middle area that opens. Make sure you are 100% synchronized , otherwise it won\u2019t work. Also make sure you are running latest version of Sia-UI since there was a fork at version 1.5.4. If you had Sia-UI previously installed, didn\u2019t update before February 2020 and launched any older version first, you are most likely on wrong blockchain and experiencing issues with transactions. You will need to re-sync in order to fix it. In such case continue check How to re-sync Sia-UI in our FAQ . If everything is ok, you can send Siacoin easily by specifying amount of SC you want to send and wallet address you want to send it to. Just make sure to not send full balance. You need to leave tiny amount of SC so there is enough left to cover transaction fees. Easiest way to do so is to send 0.5 \u2013 1 SC less than full balance. Sending from Sia Central This option is great since it allows you near instant access. No need to sync blockchain and you can quickly load any seed. Once your wallet is unlocked, just click Send and specify recipient's address and amount you want to send. Sia Central will let you know about transaction fee and remaining balance. Once satisfied, just confirm transaction by clicking on Send button.

Written by: Danger & Covalent, Last Edit: April 14, 2021","title":"Sending from Sia Central"},{"location":"skynet/introduction/index.html","text":"Introduction to Skynet Before reading this article, you should read the Introduction to Sia article and the technical side of renting article to have a better bearing of how everything works, and who is behind the project. While the top level ideas can be grasped pretty easily, the design behind Sia can be pretty complex, so keep that in mind. If you want to read what Skynet is, can do today and can achieve in future from authors themselves, don\u2019t miss A Deep Dive into Skynet on the Sia blog (published in Feb 2021). What is Skynet? Skynet is a first party layer two solution to a decentralized file space that was built on top of the existing Sia network. So basically it allows file sharing. Often, people will ask if Sia is dead because Skynet has taken over the devs priorities for the time being(though it is soon core development will be taken over by the Sia Foundation, read more here ). This is a misconception. Unlike other projects like IPFS & Filecoin who are by the same devs but have completely different code bases, Sia has to exist for Skynet to work. After all, a Skynet renter node is just a Sia renter node with a lot of contracts. So Sia itself won\u2019t, and hasn\u2019t, halted production since the inception of Skynet. You can find official Siasky.net support site and guides here . How does Skynet work in theory? I\u2019m going to get a little bit more technical here, so make sure to read the renting article first. So the base level for how Skynet works is it that every node that wants to be able to access Skyfiles forms contracts with as many hosts as possible on the network. Then, when a node wants to upload a file, it sends the data off to a subset of that massive host pool and generates something called a Skylink . A Skylink is a 46 character string of base64 encoded data. This data represents a couple things, but for the most part, this link is storing the Merkle root of the file. Merkle roots are complicated and you can dive more into them in this paper written by the head of the Sia Foundation, Luke Champine. But basically, Skylinks are just unique file identifiers; every single combination of data (think video file) and metadata (think file size) has a unique Merkle tree root . To learn more about Skyfiles, see here . Then when you want to query a specific Skylink (think if you\u2019re requesting a video on Skyfeed), your Skynet node make a bunch of requests to hosts it has contracted with to see if they have the Skylink in question. The first host to respond with the data chunk then sends over the file to the renter node, and gets paid. In practice, fetch latency can be incredibly small, rivaling that of the centralized internet. How does Skynet work in practice? Unfortunately, as of today you cannot just run a Skynet portal in your browser (though this is being worked on by the Sia Foundation with Utreexo support). Due to the many limitations of running a Sia full node talked about in the Before You Start article, running a renter node is hard on your system. The main hard parts are: Consensus is 22GB (not exactly something you can do in browser) It requires high up-time to maintain files Requires a lot of RAM High CPU load (would kill battery life) So how did the team work around this? Well the idea is to use something called a Skynet Portal . Skynet Portals A Skynet portal is a simple concept in practice. It effectively is an entry point to using the Sia network without having to run a node yourself. So someone else runs a dedicated server running a Sia node with Skynet turned on, and there\u2019s a front end in front of that that allows users to interact with it. For example, check out siasky , Skynet Lab\u2019s official portal. You can find more portals in our list of Skynet Portals . But what separates this from any other centralized file sharing platform out there like Dropbox or Mediafire? Well the main differentiator is that since the portals use the Sia network as a backend instead of their own servers, every file is available on every portal. For example Big Buck Bunny (an old Blender open source video file) is fully available at siasky.net , skyportal.xyz and every other Skynet Portal at this Sia link: sia://CACqf4NlIMlA0CCCieYGjpViPGyfyJ4v1x3bmuCKZX8FKA. But these are not a duplicates of the file. You always access the same file, just through different portals. This is the next level up from federated, it\u2019s decentralized! Note, often people claim that Skynet isn\u2019t decentralized because the ingress/egress points are centralized. This is a fair point. But currently it isn\u2019t possible to make something with a higher level of decentralization. It is being worked on, as stated above, but having site interoperability is pretty awesome in itself. Any file can be accessed from any portal, no matter who pins it or where they are. Now, each portal respectively can block any file they would like(for example, Skynet Labs won\u2019t be paying for you to access content that\u2019s illegal in their jurisdiction), but since anyone can set up their own portal, it\u2019s not a huge issue. Also setting up your own Skynet portal isn\u2019t easy, per say, but it is do-able if you have technical chops. For a guide on how to do this, look here . What about the registry? I haven\u2019t talked about this so far because I didn\u2019t want to overwhelm the reader with new stuff. But the registry, in essence, is a mutable file pointer built on top of the Sia network. Okay, but what does that mean? Each registry entry itself is only 256B on the hosts storage(usually on the main SSD) and it contains a couple things, though the only one I\u2019m gonna be focusing on is the data field. In that data field, you can store up to 128B of whatever data you would like (though this is generally used to store a single Skylink ). The registry works by effectively generating a private-public key pair and publishing the public key out there for everyone to access. Then stored inside this entry is the data field which can be changed at any time. But since the original creator is the only one who can sign the data with the private key, anyone accessing the entry knows this version of it was generated by the original user with the private key, public entries are not a thing as of now. Now, technically, you could store whatever data you\u2019d like in this \u201cdata\u201d field, so you\u2019d wonder why people wouldn\u2019t store data directly in a registry instead of just a pointer to a Skyfile (like a photo for example). Well the main reason is cost. In order to upload that 256B file, you pay 50 hosts for 64KB off contract. So in total, for that 128B field, you end up paying for 3.2MB of space! Now, since it\u2019s off contract, you don\u2019t have to deal with the minimum file size, but you would have to pay for 25600x overhead so it\u2019s no super practical. Also, another fun thing is that you pay one time to form a registry entry for 10 years in advance and don\u2019t pay upkeep for the registry entry, so once it\u2019s up, it\u2019ll stay up in perpetuity (though it\u2019ll slowly degrade in redundancy over time because hosts don\u2019t have to put up collateral for registry entries). Updating the entry with new information will refresh the host count. Side note, the registry is a database, it\u2019s called SkyDB after all. But it is not a relational database like SQL, it\u2019s a key-value store architecture. This can be somewhat limiting for some applications. To learn more about the registry, see here . What can I do with Skynet? As listed above, currently, Skynet has two real features; those being Skyfiles , which are accessible from any portal, and the registry(which when accessed through the SDK is referred to as SkyDB ), which are mutable pointers that can be accessed or updated from any portal. Currently the biggest things on Skynet are Skyfeed and content distribution by using Skynet as a CDN on sites like DTube . Skyfeed Skyfeed is a first Facebook-esque social media built on top of Skynet by community member Redsolver. It\u2019s flagship features are mainly that if you run your own portal no one can limit your speech, and that there are no ads or tracking to speak of. CDN Capabilities The first thing that Skynet was advertised as was a CDN with decentralized frills, and it is still pretty good at that. Though, because of the traditional web architecture that web portals are built on, they completely rely on horizontal load balancing to scale. Also due to the nature of Sia, speeds cap at about 1GBPS per node, so a huge amount of nodes and load balancing is required to accomplish something like a large live event. For example, if you wanted to have a streaming platform with 100k concurrent viewers, you would need 1k-2k nodes at a minimum (depending on quality of the stream). This will be fixed once Utreexo is implemented(or host\u2192user websockets), but for the time being, it\u2019s a lot of work just like any other CDN. Though, unlike traditional web architectures, the actual pool of data itself can be massive per portal node because they have access to every Skyfile and SkyDB entry. Discover more Skynet Apps . Moving forward Skynet is still under heavy development by Skynet Labs and a breadth of features are in the pipeline. For example, upcoming features include: Utreexo Beefed up SkyDB pipeline with web sockets Content monetization Direct host \u2192 user web sockets Massive performance improvements per node Node scalability improvements And much more This article is pretty much done, to learn more read about building on skynet .

So basically it allows file sharing. Often, people will ask if Sia is dead because Skynet has taken over the devs priorities for the time being(though it is soon core development will be taken over by the Sia Foundation, read more here ). This is a misconception. Unlike other projects like IPFS & Filecoin who are by the same devs but have completely different code bases, Sia has to exist for Skynet to work. After all, a Skynet renter node is just a Sia renter node with a lot of contracts. So Sia itself won\u2019t, and hasn\u2019t, halted production since the inception of Skynet. You can find official Siasky.net support site and guides here .","title":"What is Skynet?"},{"location":"skynet/introduction/index.html#how-does-skynet-work-in-theory","text":"I\u2019m going to get a little bit more technical here, so make sure to read the renting article first. So the base level for how Skynet works is it that every node that wants to be able to access Skyfiles forms contracts with as many hosts as possible on the network. Then, when a node wants to upload a file, it sends the data off to a subset of that massive host pool and generates something called a Skylink . A Skylink is a 46 character string of base64 encoded data. This data represents a couple things, but for the most part, this link is storing the Merkle root of the file. Merkle roots are complicated and you can dive more into them in this paper written by the head of the Sia Foundation, Luke Champine. But basically, Skylinks are just unique file identifiers; every single combination of data (think video file) and metadata (think file size) has a unique Merkle tree root . To learn more about Skyfiles, see here . Then when you want to query a specific Skylink (think if you\u2019re requesting a video on Skyfeed), your Skynet node make a bunch of requests to hosts it has contracted with to see if they have the Skylink in question. The first host to respond with the data chunk then sends over the file to the renter node, and gets paid. In practice, fetch latency can be incredibly small, rivaling that of the centralized internet.","title":"How does Skynet work in theory?"},{"location":"skynet/introduction/index.html#how-does-skynet-work-in-practice","text":"Unfortunately, as of today you cannot just run a Skynet portal in your browser (though this is being worked on by the Sia Foundation with Utreexo support). Due to the many limitations of running a Sia full node talked about in the Before You Start article, running a renter node is hard on your system. The main hard parts are: Consensus is 22GB (not exactly something you can do in browser) It requires high up-time to maintain files Requires a lot of RAM High CPU load (would kill battery life) So how did the team work around this? Well the idea is to use something called a Skynet Portal .","title":"How does Skynet work in practice?"},{"location":"skynet/introduction/index.html#skynet-portals","text":"A Skynet portal is a simple concept in practice. It effectively is an entry point to using the Sia network without having to run a node yourself. So someone else runs a dedicated server running a Sia node with Skynet turned on, and there\u2019s a front end in front of that that allows users to interact with it. For example, check out siasky , Skynet Lab\u2019s official portal. You can find more portals in our list of Skynet Portals . But what separates this from any other centralized file sharing platform out there like Dropbox or Mediafire? Well the main differentiator is that since the portals use the Sia network as a backend instead of their own servers, every file is available on every portal. For example Big Buck Bunny (an old Blender open source video file) is fully available at siasky.net , skyportal.xyz and every other Skynet Portal at this Sia link: sia://CACqf4NlIMlA0CCCieYGjpViPGyfyJ4v1x3bmuCKZX8FKA. But these are not a duplicates of the file. You always access the same file, just through different portals. This is the next level up from federated, it\u2019s decentralized! Note, often people claim that Skynet isn\u2019t decentralized because the ingress/egress points are centralized. This is a fair point. But currently it isn\u2019t possible to make something with a higher level of decentralization. It is being worked on, as stated above, but having site interoperability is pretty awesome in itself. Any file can be accessed from any portal, no matter who pins it or where they are. Now, each portal respectively can block any file they would like(for example, Skynet Labs won\u2019t be paying for you to access content that\u2019s illegal in their jurisdiction), but since anyone can set up their own portal, it\u2019s not a huge issue. Also setting up your own Skynet portal isn\u2019t easy, per say, but it is do-able if you have technical chops. For a guide on how to do this, look here .","title":"Skynet Portals"},{"location":"skynet/introduction/index.html#what-about-the-registry","text":"I haven\u2019t talked about this so far because I didn\u2019t want to overwhelm the reader with new stuff.

There are safer and faster alternatives to wetransfer.com or FTP. Here\u2019s how to use Skynet and SkySend. Filesharing is a daily need, be it in business or private. If you need to send large files to a remote colleague or just want to share a video from your last vacation with friends and family, there are common options like the specialized website wetransfer.com or cloud services like Dropbox and Google Drive. But these solutions are centralized and come with a natural twist. You have no guarantee that your files stay online every given second or the services won\u2019t be hacked, giving cybercriminals access to your sensitive business or private files and personal data. In this tutorial, we will guide you through using Skynet as an alternative, the layer 2-solution of Sia network. If you want to send a file just once or for a limited time, Skynet offers great services without the need of a user registration. Encryption and file-splitting on a trustless decentralized network will ensure, you \u2013 and noone else \u2013 can obtain power over your data. We also cover Skynet accounts, with which you can store and share your files forever. At the end, you find a little comparison of the basic features and what to consider, when using any of the mentioned services in this article. Option #1: How to send up to 8 GB for free without registration Skynet offers different ways to easily send large files without registration. We focus on SiaSky and SkySend , since they are the first available services for filesharing on Skynet. These are simple solutions to upload your data and share them with anyone you like. For files smaller than 1GB, you can just use siasky.net. But if you need something more, in order to get around the size limitation, you need to use some app that achieves the same result, but differently. Such an app is SkySend developed by redsolver and you can send up to 8GB with it. But keep in mind: Both SiaSky and SkySend are not final at the time of writing. SiaSky is meant for quick filesharing purposes and doesn\u2019t offer end-2-end encryption at the moment. For SkySend, the encryption still needs to be audited. So consider not to using these services for sensitive data for the time being. How to upload and share your files up to 1GB without registration (up to 90 days) Visit Siasky(https://siasky.net/) and you\u2019ll find a self-explanatory interface click on \u201cBrowse\u201c and choose a file for uploading from your device. If you want to send a bunch of files, which in total are less than 1GB, we recommend to pack them into one archive file, i.e. with 7-Zip. With 7-Zip you can also consider to protect your file or archive with a password to optimize security. Depending on your internet connection, the upload will take some time. You can also upload folders and then reference the individual files where needed by adding \u201c/folder/index.html\u201d after the skylink. Once your upload is complete, siasky.net will give you a Skylink. With this link, you or your colleagues, family and friends can download your file. Make sure to save the Skylink for up to 90 days, if you want to share your files again at a later point. After these 90 days, the file is not pinned on Skynet anymore, and thus gets lost. How to upload and share files up to 8GB without registration (up to 90 days) If you are in need of sending single files or archives up to 8GB, we recommend SkySend. Here\u2019s how to use it for free and without any registration process: Visit SkySend , you find a minimalistic interface which offers everything you need. Click on \u201cBrowse\u201d and choose your file for upload. Depending on the file-size and your internet connection, it can take a while. As you can see, the file is split and encrypted, giving you a maximum of security. Once your upload has finished, you will get a link, that \u2013 as before \u2013 can be shared with anyone you like. Make sure to save it for up to 90 days, if you want to share your files again at a later point. After these 90 days, the file is not pinned on Skynet anymore, and thus gets lost. Both these approaches are sharing the limited availability for up to 90 days. If you ask why, it is because in both cases we are using the siasky.net portal for the actual upload. Just in the second case, the data is not uploaded by the siasky.net app, but by SkySend that does it differently \u2013 splits it into pieces that match the limit and creates a new skyfile with references to the pieces and code necessary to rebuild the file. But since the actual uploaded data goes through the same portal, it shares the same limitations for unregistered users. However, if you want to upload temporarily, this gives you the ability to use any portal you want. See our list here. Option #2: How to upload, store and share your files for lifetime You can sign-up for free on siasky.net, get 100 GB free cloud storage for lifetime and can share your files online with anyone within seconds \u2013 without any cost! For the time being, all you need is an email address and a password to get access to your personal dashboard. The dashboard gives you an overview of every upload and generated skylink that you have created while you were logged in. How to setup your Skynet account Visit https://siasky.net/ and click on \u201cSign up now!\u201c Provide an email address and choose a password to setup your account When you are logged in, any upload going through SiaSky.net will be collected on your dashboard with the appropriate Skylink. This includes not just SiaSky.net itself, but any Skynet app you are accessing through a SiaSky.net portal \u2013 like SkyID, Marstorage, SkyFeed, simply everything \u2026 Notice: At the time being, SkySend-links are not visible on the SiaSky dashboard. Skynet Labs are working on DAC (Data Access Controller) and details will be revealed soon, which will allow Skapp developers to make it way cooler and easy to use. What does it mean for you right now? If you use SkySend, make sure to save your SkySend-links separately, until DAC is integrated. Only SiaSky links can be obtained from the dashboard right now. Your files are hosted for lifetime without any limit and can be shared for as long as you wish. If you ask how it is possible to get this all for free and for a lifetime, you should learn more about the Skynet monetization model. Best resource available right now is from the developers themselves: A Deep Dive into Skynet . Did you know? As a free SiaSky user, you can use 7-Zip or any other similar program to split your own archives bigger than 8GB into pieces, each not bigger than 1GB (or 8GB in the future, after DAC has been deployed). If you want to avoid splitting files, consider to sign-up for one of the paid plans. They will give you even more freedom. Being logged in, you can check the tiers and Skynet prices on the appropriate site. Though keep in mind that the 1GB per-file-limit has not yet been lifted on portals. That should be next in line to change though. SiaSky & SkySend vs. WeTransfer, Google Drive and Dropbox The following table gives you an overview of storage capacities of SiaSky, SkySend and centralized competitors like WeTransfer, Google Drive and Dropbox. Service SiaSky.net / SkySend wetransfer.com Google Drive Dropbox Developer Skynet Labs / Sia Community WeTransfer Google Dropbox Technology decentralized(ish) centralized centralized centralized Encryption No / AES256 AES256 AES128 for storage AES256 Free transfer (without registration) Yes Yes (recepient and sender email required) No No File size limitation 1 / 8GB 2GB 15GB 2GB (100MB for sending) Storage (free use after registration) 100GB 2GB 15GB 2GB Hosting duration (free use) unlimited with registration,90 days without it 7 days (10 downloads) \u2013 \u2013 Download speed unlimited unlimited unlimited unlimited Plans and features for paying users If you plan to use a storage solution for longterm, it\u2019s worth to look into pricing and the available plans. This is, what the services offer: SiaSky plans are simple. You get 100 GB for free. Beginning with $5/month for Skynet Plus, you can use 1TB. You get 4TB for $20/month with Skynet Pro and 20TB for $80/month with Skynet Extreme. WeTransfer offers Pro subscription for 12$/month. That will only give you 1TB storage, but you can send files with 20GB in size which can be shared via email 50 times. Google Drive has Google One as a paid plan, beginning at 1.99$/month for 100GB. That is a tenth of Skynet Plus\u2019 storage capacity for 40% the price of the same Skynet plan. Further, Google gives you 200GB for 2.99$/month and 2TB for 9.99$/month. Comparing the highest tier of Google to Skynet Extreme in theory, you would have to pay 20% more for Google, to get the same amount of storage. Dropbox Plus begins at 9.99$/month without extending your 2TB storage. The limit per transfer is set to 2GB. Concentrating on these numbers alone, the 16.99$/month-family-plan just gives another 5 users access to the same storage capacity. Conclusion SiaSky and SkySend \u2013 or in essence Sia\u2019s layer two, Skynet \u2013 is your primary choice, if you don\u2019t want your data being stored by a centralized corporation. Comparing storage capacity and price, SiaSky is within a throwing distance of the competitors in terms of price/performance, while allowing a fully open API for skapp devs to take advantage of. Skynet is in active development and new features will be added time after time. Using SiaSky storage, you can easily manage your files on Skynet. Read this guide to understand, why you need Skynet .

We focus on SiaSky and SkySend , since they are the first available services for filesharing on Skynet. These are simple solutions to upload your data and share them with anyone you like. For files smaller than 1GB, you can just use siasky.net. But if you need something more, in order to get around the size limitation, you need to use some app that achieves the same result, but differently. Such an app is SkySend developed by redsolver and you can send up to 8GB with it. But keep in mind: Both SiaSky and SkySend are not final at the time of writing. SiaSky is meant for quick filesharing purposes and doesn\u2019t offer end-2-end encryption at the moment. For SkySend, the encryption still needs to be audited. So consider not to using these services for sensitive data for the time being.","title":"Option #1: How to send up to 8 GB for free without registration"},{"location":"skynet-for-users/sending-files-over-skynet/index.html#how-to-upload-and-share-your-files-up-to-1gb-without-registration-up-to-90-days","text":"Visit Siasky(https://siasky.net/) and you\u2019ll find a self-explanatory interface click on \u201cBrowse\u201c and choose a file for uploading from your device. If you want to send a bunch of files, which in total are less than 1GB, we recommend to pack them into one archive file, i.e. with 7-Zip. With 7-Zip you can also consider to protect your file or archive with a password to optimize security. Depending on your internet connection, the upload will take some time. You can also upload folders and then reference the individual files where needed by adding \u201c/folder/index.html\u201d after the skylink. Once your upload is complete, siasky.net will give you a Skylink. With this link, you or your colleagues, family and friends can download your file. Make sure to save the Skylink for up to 90 days, if you want to share your files again at a later point. After these 90 days, the file is not pinned on Skynet anymore, and thus gets lost.","title":"How to upload and share your files up to 1GB without registration (up to 90 days)"},{"location":"skynet-for-users/sending-files-over-skynet/index.html#how-to-upload-and-share-files-up-to-8gb-without-registration-up-to-90-days","text":"If you are in need of sending single files or archives up to 8GB, we recommend SkySend. Here\u2019s how to use it for free and without any registration process: Visit SkySend , you find a minimalistic interface which offers everything you need. Click on \u201cBrowse\u201d and choose your file for upload. Depending on the file-size and your internet connection, it can take a while. As you can see, the file is split and encrypted, giving you a maximum of security. Once your upload has finished, you will get a link, that \u2013 as before \u2013 can be shared with anyone you like. Make sure to save it for up to 90 days, if you want to share your files again at a later point. After these 90 days, the file is not pinned on Skynet anymore, and thus gets lost. Both these approaches are sharing the limited availability for up to 90 days. If you ask why, it is because in both cases we are using the siasky.net portal for the actual upload. Just in the second case, the data is not uploaded by the siasky.net app, but by SkySend that does it differently \u2013 splits it into pieces that match the limit and creates a new skyfile with references to the pieces and code necessary to rebuild the file. But since the actual uploaded data goes through the same portal, it shares the same limitations for unregistered users. However, if you want to upload temporarily, this gives you the ability to use any portal you want. See our list here.","title":"How to upload and share files up to 8GB without registration (up to 90 days)"},{"location":"skynet-for-users/sending-files-over-skynet/index.html#option-2-how-to-upload-store-and-share-your-files-for-lifetime","text":"You can sign-up for free on siasky.net, get 100 GB free cloud storage for lifetime and can share your files online with anyone within seconds \u2013 without any cost!

Your files are hosted for lifetime without any limit and can be shared for as long as you wish. If you ask how it is possible to get this all for free and for a lifetime, you should learn more about the Skynet monetization model. Best resource available right now is from the developers themselves: A Deep Dive into Skynet . Did you know? As a free SiaSky user, you can use 7-Zip or any other similar program to split your own archives bigger than 8GB into pieces, each not bigger than 1GB (or 8GB in the future, after DAC has been deployed). If you want to avoid splitting files, consider to sign-up for one of the paid plans. They will give you even more freedom. Being logged in, you can check the tiers and Skynet prices on the appropriate site. Though keep in mind that the 1GB per-file-limit has not yet been lifted on portals.

This is surely the question in your mind right now. Maybe you discovered someone talking about it on the internet, or your friend is convincing you why Sia and Skynet are the future of the internet. Or you are just someone looking for decentralized alternatives to activities you\u2019re performing every single day. Before we dig into the use cases, let\u2019s take a look at the current internet and compare it with Skynet. Restart the internet I won\u2019t lie to you. Skynet is new. And even a year or two later it will still be new \u2013 the same as the internet was still a new thing to many people in the early 2000s. Back then, most of the apps you are using today didn\u2019t exist. It took a lot of time for the internet to become what it is today\u2026 and in many ways, become something we are disgusted at since we can\u2019t really do anything to change it. Today your data is stored across millions of servers and databases in isolated silos owned by the companies holding your data and selling it to anyone for profit. The Internet is not free, you\u2019re paying with your privacy that gets monetized. Also, each new service needs to build its own user base and network effect from zero. It doesn\u2019t matter if it\u2019s 1000 times better with a more user friendly model \u2013 it won\u2019t survive in this merciless competition. Innovation is being supressed. Rules are defined by giants (Apple, Google and others). Content creators are being de-platformed and silenced. There are even way more ridiculous things happening and you know this is just the tip of the iceberg. What can we do about it? Well, we can restart the internet. Get in control of your data and privacy\u2026 easily Skynet is presenting a new kind of internet, a decentralized one. Built with open-source software on top of the fully decentralized cloud storage platform known as Sia. If you want to learn more, check our other guides. But most important thing is that you don\u2019t need to know much to start. You don\u2019t need any special software. You don\u2019t need to run any server. You don\u2019t need any Siacoin (SC). All you need is an account on a portal of your choice. All these guides will be using siasky.net as the official Skynet portal operated by the developers of Skynet. But it\u2019s open source, so anyone can start a business and become a player in the decentralized cloud storage market or run an own portal just for the own needs, family or friends. You can always migrate to any other portal if you\u2019re not happy, simply telling another portal to start pinning all your data. But we will leave that for a separate guide later. There are resources that explain it much better. If you want to learn more about Skynet\u2019s vision which is close to a roadmap, check this \u201cA Deep Dive into Skynet\u201d article on the official Sia blog. Let\u2019s look at a bit condensed version. What is the minimum I need to know to begin? Skynet apps are running client-side. When you are accessing some Skynet app, you download its entire code. It doesn\u2019t have to connect anywhere (at least not those apps that claim to be fully decentralized), it has everything it needs and connects to Skynet directly through the portal you use. Skynet is not encrypted by default, encryption is defined on the app level. For these reasons, siasky.net uploads should only be used if you\u2019re fine that what you upload will be available without any encryption. It\u2019s not good for personal data. But there is no limit on what users can accomplish using other apps \u2013 some allow just non-encrypted upload, some offer also encrypted upload and some do a mix of both approaches for different types of data. Your data is always stored redundantly. All files up to the base sector size are stored with 10x redundancy. This applies to all smaller files (let\u2019s say up to the size of an mp3 song). Bigger files are stored with 3x redundancy. This means your files or fragments of files exist multiple times on the network and are automatically re-uploaded to another host in order to maintain good health of your files in case of some host holding pieces of your data disappears. Anyone can run a Skynet portal with own rules and integrate new features. It\u2019s open-source. Let\u2019s say your favorite portal has a limit for a maximum upload of 1GB. If you need more, you have two options. To use some Skynet app that works around that limit, for example as SkySend ( see our guide here ). Or, if you\u2019re not happy with some portal, you can always move to another one or run your own. This is what makes the difference from the centralized internet. When some site goes offline, you lose all your data. But on Skynet, the data is stored on the underlaying Sia network that is deeply integrated with Skynet. All you have to do is to tell your portal (or just a Sia renter node in \u201cportal mode\u201d) to start pinning the list of all your Skylinks. You can use any Skynet portal to access any Skylink. Just change the domain name in the skylink to something else. Find a list (may be incomplete) here . Skynet is decentralized internet. It\u2019s not a single app, it is a way to access and utilize the decentralized storage network in a way that lets you upload anything you want and host it without need of a server. It can be a document, song, video, or entire complex application, like SkyFeed (decentralized twitter), Marstorage (decentralized dropbox) and others. All Skynet portals let you access the same files at the same hosts on Sia network through Skylinks (way of addressing specific content on decentralized network) so you\u2019re not depending on single point of access. Built-in monetization and natural app cross-operability. As you can read in the article mentioned above (\u201cA Deep Dive to Skynet\u201d), Skynet has monetization deeply integrated in its veins. Skynet portals are paying Sia hosts with SC so the users don\u2019t have to worry about running a node or a wallet. And this goes way beyond with recursive monetization being worked on allowing limitless innovations. Imagine making an image, setting a fee to it and anyone can use it in the own app and you get paid each time it is displayed, automatically. Or getting paid for curating, filtering content for other users who follow you. Or getting paid for answering questions, or even asking them on a skynet powered forum. And if you think this is all, you\u2019re wrong. Applications can use same data, if a user allows that. Apps do not need to build their own network effect, they can build on top of the network effect of all other apps. Imagine using a decentralized facebook and then discovering a better interface, letting you work with the same data plus way more. You can start using it without your friends even noticing, since they will still see your activity. Skylinks are content based. You can read more about this in other linked resources but shortly said, you don\u2019t need to upload the file to know its Skylink. You can do so before it, because identical file (content and name) will always result in the same Skylink. This is especially useful if you have some favorite app. When you access it through the Skylink, you can be always sure it was not modified and no one added any malicious code. Where to go from here? I know, you want to use it already. We are currently working on more guides that will lead you through account creation and various Skynet apps (shortly Skapps) to use.
